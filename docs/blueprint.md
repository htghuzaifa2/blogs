## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) / RGB(35, 130, 251) - A calming blue to align with trust and readability, suitable for a blog.

- Accent color: HSL(180, 50%, 50%) / RGB(63, 191, 191) - Teal provides contrast and highlights interactive elements, fitting with the informative intent of the site, and provides more contrast than the primary for a more bold styling.

- Headline: 'Playfair' a high contrast modern sans-serif
- Use a clean, card-based layout for blog posts.
