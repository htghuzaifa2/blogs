## Introduction: Why Node.js and Express for APIs?
<p>Node.js's non-blocking architecture makes it perfect for fast, scalable network applications. Paired with the minimalist Express framework, it's the ideal choice for building REST APIs.</p>

### Chapter 1: Project Setup
<p>Initialize a new Node.js project and install Express. Create a basic server to listen on a port and respond to a simple GET request.</p>

### Chapter 2: Structuring Your Application with Routes and Controllers
<p>For maintainability, separate your concerns. Create a `/routes` directory for your API endpoints and a `/controllers` directory to hold the logic for each route. This keeps your code clean and organized.</p>
      
<div className="italic text-center text-muted-foreground pt-4 border-t mt-8">
  A request arrives, a route takes flight,<br/>
  In Node's domain, all logic's right.
</div>
