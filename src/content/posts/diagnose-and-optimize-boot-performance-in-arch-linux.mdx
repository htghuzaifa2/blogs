# How to Diagnose and Fix Slow Boot Times in Arch Linux

## Diagnose Boot Performance with systemd-analyze

Start by understanding where time is being spent during your boot process using these essential commands:

| Command                      | Purpose                  | What It Reveals                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `systemd-analyze time`         | Overall time breakdown   | Firmware, loader, kernel, and userspace boot times              |
| `systemd-analyze blame`        | Service initialization times | All running units ordered by startup time                       |
| `systemd-analyze critical-chain` | Critical path analysis   | Dependency chain showing what delays graphical/multi-user target |
| `systemd-analyze plot > boot.svg` | Visual boot timeline     | Graphical representation of entire boot process                 |

Example output interpretation:

```bash
Startup finished in 8.075s (firmware) + 3.495s (loader) + 1.414s (kernel) + 1min 30.309s (userspace) = 1min 43.295s
```

This shows the userspace phase is the main bottleneck at 1 minute 30 seconds.

## Common Slow Boot Issues and Solutions

### Service Conflicts and Timeouts

Multiple Network Managers: Having conflicting services like `systemd-networkd`, `iwd`, `dhcpcd`, and `netctl` enabled simultaneously causes delays. Choose one and disable the others.

Slow Services: Use `systemd-analyze blame` to identify services taking excessive time. Consider delaying non-essential services or using socket activation.

### Socket Activation for Heavy Services

For services like Docker that significantly impact boot time, replace direct service startup with socket activation:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable docker.service
sudo systemctl enable docker.socket
```

This starts Docker only when first needed, removing it from the critical boot path. One user reported boot time reduction from 68 seconds to 28 seconds using this method.

### Hardware-Specific Issues

**Slow Kernel Time:** If kernel phase takes >10 seconds (like 33s in one case), this may indicate storage or hardware issues. Check for AMD GPU timeout messages or storage controller problems in `journalctl` logs.

**Wait for Network:** Services like `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service` can delay boot. Consider if your system truly needs full network connectivity before boot completion.

## Optimization Checklist

Apply these additional optimizations for better boot performance:

-   **Review Enabled Services:** Disable unnecessary services with `systemctl disable service.name`
-   **Kernel Parameters:** Add `libahci.ignore_sss=1` to disable staggered spin-up on some hardware
-   **Filesystem Mount Options:** Use `noauto,x-systemd.automount` for non-critical filesystems like `/home` to mount on first access
-   **Initramfs Optimization:** Consider slimmer alternatives like Booster or `mkinitcpio` with `systemd` hook instead of `base` and `udev`
-   **UEFI Firmware:** Update your motherboard BIOS/UEFI, as slow firmware initialization contributes to boot time

## Putting It All Together: A Real-World Example

Here's how one user solved their 1 minute 43 second boot time:

1.  **Identified the Culprit:** `systemd-analyze critical-chain` showed `network.target` waiting over a minute
2.  **Discovered Root Cause:** Multiple conflicting network services (`iwd`, `dhcpcd`, `systemd-networkd`)
3.  **Applied Fix:** Consolidated to a single network management solution
4.  **Verified Improvement:** Boot time reduced significantly after resolving conflicts

After applying the relevant optimizations for your system, run `systemd-analyze` again to compare results. Most systems can achieve 15-30 second boot times with proper tuning.
