Installing graphics drivers properly is one of the most important steps after setting up Arch Linux. Whether you’re using Intel integrated graphics (like HD 4000) or a dedicated NVIDIA GPU, the right driver ensures smooth performance, proper hardware acceleration, and lag-free video playback.

This guide covers both NVIDIA and Intel graphics setup—from driver installation to troubleshooting common issues.

## Why Do Drivers Matter?

Without the correct drivers, your system can suffer from:
-   Video playback that lags or tears.
-   Games and rendering apps that crash.
-   GPU features like hardware acceleration not working.
-   The system falling back to software rendering, increasing CPU load.

Installing the right driver fixes all of this.

## Step 1: Update Your System

Always start by syncing your package database and upgrading your system:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```
This ensures you’re working with the latest kernel and package versions—critical for compatibility.

## Step 2: Identify Your Graphics Card

Run the following command to detect your GPU:
```bash
lspci | grep -E "VGA|3D"
```
Example output:
```
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation HD Graphics 4000
01:00.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK107M [GeForce GT 650M]
```
This shows both Intel and NVIDIA GPUs, which is common on laptops with hybrid graphics.

## Step 3: Install Graphics Drivers

### For Intel Graphics (HD, UHD, or Iris)

Arch Linux already supports Intel GPUs via open-source Mesa drivers. Run:
```bash
sudo pacman -S mesa lib32-mesa vulkan-intel lib32-vulkan-intel
```
For video acceleration (hardware-accelerated decoding):
```bash
sudo pacman -S libva-intel-driver intel-media-driver
```
**Tip:** `intel-media-driver` is for 8th Gen or newer CPUs, while `libva-intel-driver` works better for older ones (like HD 4000).

### For NVIDIA Graphics

First, detect your GPU series with `lspci | grep -E "NVIDIA"`, then install the correct driver.

| GPU Type                         | Package                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Modern (GTX 900 series & newer)  | `nvidia nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils` |
| Older (GTX 600 / 700 series)     | `nvidia-470xx-dkms nvidia-470xx-utils`  |
| Legacy cards                     | `nvidia-390xx-dkms`                     |

Example for modern cards:
```bash
sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils
```

If you use a custom kernel, install DKMS to rebuild drivers on updates:
```bash
sudo pacman -S dkms
```

## Step 4: Enable Hardware Acceleration

### For Intel
Create or edit `/etc/environment` and add:
```
LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=iHD
VDPAU_DRIVER=va_gl
```
Reboot and test with `mpv --hwdec=auto video.mp4`.

### For NVIDIA
Install Vulkan and VDPAU packages:
```bash
sudo pacman -S nvidia-settings nvidia-utils libvdpau libva-vdpau-driver lib32-libvdpau
```
Load the kernel module with `sudo modprobe nvidia` and verify with `nvidia-smi`.

## Step 5: Enable Hybrid Graphics (Laptops Only)

If your laptop has both Intel + NVIDIA GPUs, install PRIME utilities:
```bash
sudo pacman -S nvidia-prime
```
To run apps using the NVIDIA GPU:
```bash
prime-run firefox
```
Add `prime-run` to your game launcher commands for Steam or Lutris.

## Step 6: Troubleshooting Common Problems

-   **Screen Tearing:** Install `picom` and run `picom --vsync`.
-   **Black Screen After Boot:** Add `nouveau.modeset=0` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` in `/etc/default/grub` and update GRUB.
-   **NVIDIA Settings Not Saving:** Run `sudo nvidia-settings` and save the configuration to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf`.

## Step 7: Verify Everything Works

-   **OpenGL:** `glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"`
-   **Vulkan:** `vulkaninfo | grep "GPU id"`

If both show your GPU names, congratulations, your setup is perfect!

### Final Thoughts

Getting graphics drivers right in Arch Linux might look technical, but once done, your system becomes buttery smooth. For Intel HD 4000, Mesa drivers are incredibly efficient in 2025. For NVIDIA, official drivers now integrate better with Wayland and modern desktops.
