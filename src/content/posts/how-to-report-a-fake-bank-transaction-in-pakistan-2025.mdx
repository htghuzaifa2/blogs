“Your FIR is now just one CNIC away—no police station visits required.”
Below are step-by-step links and apps to view, download, or verify First Information Reports for Punjab, Sindh, Islamabad (ICT), and beyond.

### ⚠️ Act Fast – 24-Hour Rule
If you notice an unauthorised debit, fake credit, or suspicious transaction, report the SAME DAY to freeze the trail and protect your money.

### 🏦 Step 1 – Contact Your Bank (Always First)

| Bank Channel                  | What to Do                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **24×7 Helpline**             | Call the toll-free number (e.g., UBL 111-825-888, HBL 111-111-425) and say “fraudulent transaction”       |
| **Branch Visit**              | Fill Dispute Form + FIR copy (see Step 3) within 5 working days                                        |
| **Bank App / Internet Banking** | Use “Report Fraud” button → upload screenshots + FIR                                                    |
*Bank must respond within 10 days (SBP rule)*.

### 🏛️ Step 2 – State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) – Consumer Protection
If your bank does NOT resolve the issue in 10 days, escalate to SBP:

| Channel       | Link / Contact                     | Documents Needed                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Online Form** | SBP Sunwai Portal                  | CNIC, bank reply, transaction slip        |
| **Email**     | cpd.helpdesk@sbp.org.pk            | Same docs + timeline                      |
| **Helpline**  | 021-111-727-273 (Mon–Fri 9 AM–5 PM) | —                                         |
*SBP resolves within 30 days for fraud cases*.

### ⚖️ Step 3 – Banking Mohtasib (if bank + SBP fail)
Use if 45 days have passed since first bank complaint:

| Channel         | Details                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Online Form**   | bankingmohtasib.gov.pk → Complaint Form                                    |
| **Email**       | info@bankingmohtasib.gov.pk                                                |
| **Postal Address** | Banking Mohtasib Pakistan, Shaheen Complex, 5th Floor, M. R. Kiyani Road, Karachi |
**Required Docs**: Bank reply + 45-day proof + CNIC.
*Decision within 2 months*.

### 🚔 Step 4 – File an FIR (for Large Fraud / Police Report)
Police Station nearest to your account branch
**Required**: CNIC, bank statement, transaction slip
**Template FIR**:
```
Subject: Cyber Fraud FIR  
Details: On [date] an amount of ₨ X was debited without my consent from my account [number] via [ATM/IBFT/UPI].  
Evidence: Attached bank statement + screenshots.
```
Attach FIR to all bank / SBP / Banking Mohtasib complaints.
