### What Is Hyper-Niche Blogging in 2025?

Hyper-niche blogging means building an entire site around one razor-thin slice of a market—so specific that Google’s autocomplete barely suggests it.

Instead of “fitness,” you blog only about “strength training for moms after C-sections.”
Instead of “finance,” you go all-in on “index-fund strategies for Pakistani freelancers on Fiverr.”

### 3-Step Formula to Spot Your 2025 Hyper-Niche

#### 1️⃣ Micro-Pain Mining

Prompt (copy-paste into ChatGPT):
```
“Give me 20 ultra-specific pain points that a [broad niche] audience complains about on Reddit but can’t find solutions for.”
```
Example output:
“How to train for a half-marathon with flat-footed over-pronation.”
“Best noise-cancelling headphones for ADHD freelancers.”

#### 2️⃣ Google Suggest Validation

Type the pain point into Google. If autocomplete <5 suggestions, you’ve struck gold.

#### 3️⃣ Search Intent Cross-Check

Open the top 3 SERPs. If they’re forums or outdated posts, the lane is wide open.
