### What Is Hyper-Niche Blogging in 2025?

Hyper-niche blogging means building an entire site around one razor-thin slice of a market”so specific that Google™s autocomplete barely suggests it.

Instead of "fitness," you blog only about "strength training for moms after C-sections."
Instead of "finance," you go all-in on "index-fund strategies for Pakistani freelancers on Fiverr."
