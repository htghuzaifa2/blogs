### What Is Hyper-Niche Blogging in 2025?

Hyper-niche blogging means building an entire site around one razor-thin slice of a marketâ€”so specific that Googleâ€™s autocomplete barely suggests it.

Instead of â€œfitness,â€ you blog only about â€œstrength training for moms after C-sections.â€
Instead of â€œfinance,â€ you go all-in on â€œindex-fund strategies for Pakistani freelancers on Fiverr.â€

| Metric             | Broad Niche | Hyper-Niche |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Keyword volume     | 50kâ€“500k    | 50â€“500      |
| SERP competition   | 100+ pages  | 3â€“5 pages   |
| Click-through rate | 2â€“4%        | 12â€“30%      |
| Monetisation RPM   | $3â€“$8       | $25â€“$150    |

### Why Hyper-Niche Beats AI-Saturated SERPs

Prompt (copy-paste into ChatGPT):
```
â€œGive me 20 ultra-specific pain points that a [broad niche] audience complains about on Reddit but canâ€™t find solutions for.â€
```
Example output:
â€œHow to train for a half-marathon with flat-footed over-pronation.â€
â€œBest noise-cancelling headphones for ADHD freelancers.â€

#### 2ï¸âƒ£ Google Suggest Validation

Type the pain point into Google. If autocomplete <5 suggestions, youâ€™ve struck gold.

#### 3ï¸âƒ£ Search Intent Cross-Check

Open the top 3 SERPs. If theyâ€™re forums or outdated posts, the lane is wide open.
