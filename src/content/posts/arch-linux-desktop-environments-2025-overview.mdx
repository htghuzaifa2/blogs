# An Overview of Desktop Environments for Arch Linux in 2025

Arch Linux remains a top choice for users who want a customizable, rolling-release distro, and pairing it with the right desktop environment (DE) can make all the difference. In 2025, the key contenders—KDE Plasma, XFCE, and GNOME—have seen updates that improve performance, features, and compatibility with Wayland. KDE Plasma 6.5 (recently out of beta) emphasizes customization and modern effects, GNOME 49 focuses on a sleek, gesture-based workflow, and XFCE 4.20 prioritizes lightweight efficiency with better Wayland support.

The "best" DE depends on your hardware, workflow, and preferences. For low-end systems or minimalism, XFCE shines. KDE offers unparalleled tweakability for power users, while GNOME provides a polished, app-centric experience. Below, I'll break down their features, followed by a benchmark comparison emphasizing RAM and CPU usage, based on recent tests from Arch-based distros like Manjaro and EndeavourOS.

## KDE Plasma

KDE Plasma is highly customizable, with widgets, effects, and a vast settings ecosystem. It's great for multitasking with virtual desktops and activities. On Arch, installation is straightforward via `pacman -S plasma`, and it supports both X11 and Wayland seamlessly. However, its feature-rich nature can lead to higher resource use if not optimized.

## XFCE

XFCE is the lightweight champion, offering a classic panel-based interface that's fast and modular. It's ideal for older hardware or users who want a no-frills setup. Install on Arch with `pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies`. Recent updates in 4.20 enhance theme consistency and Wayland compatibility, making it snappier without sacrificing usability.

## GNOME

GNOME emphasizes simplicity and productivity with its overview mode, extensions, and touch-friendly design. It's modern and integrates well with apps like Nautilus. On Arch, grab it via `pacman -S gnome`. Version 49 brings refined animations and better hardware acceleration, but it can feel extension-dependent for customization.

## Benchmark Comparison: RAM and CPU Usage

Recent 2025 benchmarks on Arch-based systems (like Manjaro 24.2.1 and EndeavourOS with kernel 6.12) show XFCE as the most efficient, followed by KDE, with GNOME using the most resources. Tests were run on virtual machines with 8 GB RAM and 5 CPUs for consistency, though real hardware would scale better. Here's a summary table of idle and loaded RAM/CPU from key sources:

| Desktop Environment      | Idle RAM (GB) | Loaded RAM (GB, ~4-5 apps open) | Idle CPU (%) | Notes/Benchmarks                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **KDE Plasma (6.5)**     | ~1.4          | ~2.2-2.6                        | ~20-30       | Highest memory events in Sysbench (56M); higher RAM than XFCE but optimized preloading; Geekbench single-core: ~2695. Good for gaming/multitasking. |
| **XFCE (4.20)**          | ~1.1          | ~1.7-1.9                        | ~20-30       | Lowest overall usage; Sysbench CPU events high on Arch; Geekbench single-core: ~2700. Snappiest on low-end hardware.                            |
| **GNOME (49)**           | ~1.5          | ~2.5-3.0                        | ~20-30       | Higher load averages in htop; Geekbench single-core: ~2645. Best with 8+ GB RAM for smooth effects.                                             |

### Key Insights from Benchmarks:

-   **RAM Efficiency:** XFCE consistently uses 200-400 MB less than KDE and GNOME at idle and under load, making it ideal for systems with 4 GB RAM or less. KDE has improved optimization in 6.5, closing the gap with GNOME.
-   **CPU Performance:** Differences are minimal (~20-30% idle across all), but XFCE and KDE edge out GNOME in Sysbench latency tests on Arch. Under load (e.g., apps + browser), GNOME hits 50-80% CPU, while others stay lower.
-   **Overall Speed:** EndeavourOS tests show Arch's rolling nature gives slight edges in memory events, but results vary by kernel. XFCE feels fastest subjectively due to low overhead.

## Recommendation

For Arch Linux in 2025:

-   Choose **XFCE** if you prioritize low resource usage and speed on modest hardware.
-   Go with **KDE Plasma** for feature-packed customization without sacrificing too much performance.
-   Pick **GNOME** for a modern, intuitive interface if you have ample RAM/CPU.

All three install easily on Arch and support the latest features like Wayland. Test them in a live environment or VM to see what fits your setup best.
