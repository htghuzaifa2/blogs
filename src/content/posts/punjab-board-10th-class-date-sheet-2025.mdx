## ðŸ“² How to Download Date Sheet (no rocket science, just taps)

### Step 1: Official Link

*   **English site:** https://pseb.ac.in
*   **Urdu site:** https://pseb.ac.in/urdu

### Step 2: Click & Save

Homepage â†’ â€œDate Sheet 2025â€ â†’ Download PDF â†’ Save to phone gallery â†’ WhatsApp to study group.

### Step 3: Backup Plan

If site crashes (it will), use SMS:

*   Type **PB10 <space>**
*   Send to **5676750**
*   Youâ€™ll get date-sheet + result alerts on your phone.

## ðŸŽ¯ Real-Life Tips (from students who survived the drum-roll)

*   **Photocopy the date-sheet** â€” stick on wall, stick on fridge, stick on momâ€™s forehead â€” visual memory > panic memory.
*   **Mock papers at 11 a.m.** â€” train your brain to be alert at exam time, not at midnight.
*   **Practical prep early** â€” Jan 27 is closer than you think â€” practice titrations now, not on Jan 26.
*   **Backup stationery** â€” two pens, two pencils, two calculators â€” because Murphyâ€™s Law loves exam halls.
*   **Mental health > mark sheet** â€” breathe, break, binge on biryani â€” then back to books.

## ðŸ† Post-Exam Roadmap (after the drum-roll stops)

*   **Result Date:** May 16, 10:00 a.m. â€” check via SMS, website, or â€œmummyâ€™s WhatsApp groupâ€.
*   **Passing Marks:** 33 % in each subject â€” 33 is the new 100 (until you cross it).
*   **Supplementary Exams:** Aug 8â€“29 â€” second chance, not second class â€” treat it like overtime, not overtime stress.

## ðŸŒ± Final Byte (in both languages)

**English:** The date sheet is not a dragon â€” itâ€™s a roadmap. Walk it, donâ€™t wrestle it.
