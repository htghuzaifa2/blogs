*(Updated 18 August 2025 | Step-by-Step Walkthrough for Citizens & Overseas Pakistanis)*

### Step 1: Download & Install

-   **Android**: Google Play Store → Search "Pakistan Citizen Portal"
-   **iOS**: App Store → Download Pakistan Citizen Portal [8]
-   **Compatibility**: Requires iOS 11+ or Android 7.0+
-   **Size**: 77.5 MB (iOS) / 55 MB (Android)

**Critical Fixes (2025 Updates):**

-   **Email Verification Bug**: If app crashes during verification, go to Menu → "Verify Email" instead of main pop-up [8].
-   **International Numbers**: Pad shorter foreign numbers with zeros during registration (e.g., 123456 → 1234560000) [8].

### Step 2: Register Your Account

1.  Open App → Tap "Register"
2.  **Enter Details**:
    -   CNIC (no dashes)
    -   Mobile number (Pakistani or padded international)
    -   Email (active for OTP)
3.  **Verify**:
    -   SMS OTP sent to mobile
    -   Email link (check spam)
4.  **Set Password**: 8+ characters with uppercase + number

**Pro Tip**: Overseas Pakistanis must register with Pakistani CNIC + foreign number (use family’s Pak number if unavailable) [4].

### Step 3: Submit a Complaint

1.  Tap "+" → Select "Complaint"
2.  **Fill Form**:
    -   **Category**: Choose from 40+ options (e.g., "Police Misconduct", "Electricity Overbilling")
    -   **Description**: Be specific: *"LESCO bill #XX-XXXXXX charged ₨12,000 for 200 units—meter photo attached."*
    -   **Attachments**: Upload bills, photos, FIRs (max 5 files, 2MB each)
    -   **Location**: Enable GPS or pin manually
3.  Submit → Note 10-digit token number (e.g., PCP-2025-XXXXXX)

**Avoid Rejection**:

-   No anonymous complaints [11].
-   Politically sensitive issues require lawyer support [4].

### Step 4: Track Complaint Status

**Method 1: App Dashboard** → "My Complaints" → View real-time stages:

| Status              | Meaning                                     | Next Step                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Received            | Complaint logged                            | Wait 48 hrs               |
| Forwarded           | Sent to relevant department (e.g., WAPDA)   | Monitor daily             |
| Under Investigation | Department verifying claims                 | Respond if evidence needed|
| Resolved            | Closed by department                        | Rate satisfaction         |

**Method 2**: SMS `PCPSTATUS <token>` to `9988` (free)

**Method 3**: Web portal → `8171.bisp.gov.pk` → Enter token/CNIC [10]

**User Alert**: Departments can mark complaints "resolved" without your consent. Demand reopening rights via app feedback [8].

### Resolution Timelines & Escalation
