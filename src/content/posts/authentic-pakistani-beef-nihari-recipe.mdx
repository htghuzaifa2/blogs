### 🕒 Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Pre-Cook Beef (Overnight)

In a heavy pot, combine:
- Beef shank + bones
- 10 cups water
- 1 tbsp salt

Simmer covered on lowest heat 6-8 hours (⚠️ Collagen breakdown is key).

**Pro Tip:** Use a thermal cooker or leave on *dum* overnight.

#### 2. Prepare Masala Base (Morning)

Heat ghee-mustard oil → fry beef fat until crisp → remove.

In the same oil:
1.  Add ginger-garlic paste → sauté 2 mins.
2.  Add nihari masala powder → fry 60 secs.
3.  Add fried onions → cook until oil separates.

#### 3. Combine & Slow-Cook

- Add masala paste to the beef pot → stir gently.
- Simmer uncovered for 2 hours.
- Skim fat occasionally → reserve for *tarka*.
- The meat should fall off the bone.

#### 4. Thicken the Gravy

- Whisk *atta* with 1 cup of cold water → create a smooth paste.
- Stir into the nihari → cook for 15 mins until silky.
- **Texture Test:** The gravy should coat a spoon like warm honey.

#### 5. Extract Marrow Magic

- Remove bones → scoop marrow into the gravy.
- Stir gently → the marrow will dissolve into richness.

### 🌟 The Tarka (Final Ritual)

Heat reserved beef fat + ¼ cup ghee:
- Add ginger juliennes → fry until golden.
- Add green chilies + 1 tsp garam masala.
- Pour sizzling over nihari.

### 🍽️ Serving Tradition

Garnish with:
- Fresh coriander
- Ginger juliennes
- Lime wedges

Pair With:
- Khamiri roti or naan
- Basmati rice (optional)
- Sliced cucumbers + radishes

"Perfect nihari oil floats crimson—a spice-stained ocean hiding molten marrow treasures."

### 🔥 Pro Secrets

**Cut Wisdom:**
- **Shank (nali):** Gelatinous richness.
- **Cheek meat:** Melts like butter.

**Heat Control:**
- Never boil → gentle bubbles only.
- **Coal smoking:** Place live coal + ghee in a foil cup on the nihari → cover for 5 mins.

**Day-After Magic:**
- Refrigerate overnight → reheat gently → flavors deepen.

**Spice Adjustment:**
- **Mild:** Reduce black pepper by 50%.
- **Fire-breathing:** Add 1 tsp ghost chili powder.

### 📜 Regional Variations

| City      | Signature Twist          |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| Lahore    | Extra marrow + brain (maghaz) |
| Karachi   | Tangy kick with lemon juice  |
| Delhi     | Added khameeri roti crumbs   |
| Hyderabadi| Coconut milk in gravy    |

**Leftover Hack:**
- **Nihari Parathas:** Shred meat → stuff in dough → griddle.
- **Nihari Omelette:** Mix with eggs → pan-fry.
