Updated 17 August 2025
“In 2025 Google doesn’t just rank pages—it ranks answers, entities and experiences. Build for that, and the rankings follow.”
Below is a zero-fluff, step-by-step checklist based on the latest algorithm leaks, AI Overviews (AIO), and what’s working in our own campaigns right now.
