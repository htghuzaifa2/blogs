### I. Turmeric vs Kojic Acid ”” The Glow-Off

| Ingredient   | Super-Power                         | Speed         | Best For                        | Warning                                      |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Turmeric** | Anti-inflammatory + gentle antioxidant | Slow & steady | Sensitive, red, acne-prone skin | Can stain towels yellow (Simpsons cosplay)     |
| **Kojic Acid** | Tyrosinase boss = melanin blocker   | Faster fade   | Stubborn melasma, sun-spots     | Can irritate if you over-do the speed-run |

**Science Snap:**

*   Kojic inhibits tyrosinase strongly â†’ faster pigment fade, but higher irritation risk.
*   Turmeric”™s curcumin calms inflammation â†’ gradual brightening, gentler for sensitive skin.

**Dad-joke:** Why did the dark spot break up with kojic?
â†’ It said, “You”™re too intense””call me when you”™ve chilled like turmeric.”

**Verdict:**

*   **Stubborn, well-defined patches** â†’ Team Kojic (start slow, SPF mandatory).
*   **Red, easily-irritated or acne skin** â†’ Team Turmeric (patience = glow).
*   **Combo strategy:** Alternate nights or pick dual-formula products””get the best of both galaxies.
