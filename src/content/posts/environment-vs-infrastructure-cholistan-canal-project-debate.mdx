| **Halt & Rethink**        | Rising                    | National water summit, glacier-melt adaptation projects instead  |

### 7. What Citizens Can Do This Week

1.  **Track CCI agenda:** cci.gov.pk
2.  **Join Sindh-Punjab water dialogues:** #SaveIndusDelta Twitter Spaces every Friday
3.  **Offset water footprint:** Install low-flow taps (cuts household use 30%)
