*â€œWe will continue fighting against these canals and wonâ€™t let the state kill us by thirst.â€*
â€” Wajahat Hussain, Sindhi human-rights lawyer, at a March 2025 protest

### 1. What Is the Cholistan Canal Project?

| Fact Sheet (2025)     | Details                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parent Plan**       | Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI) â€“ a $3.3 billion federal programme launched Feb 2025 |
| **Scope**             | 176 km canal + 2 branch canals to divert 4,120 cusecs of water               |
| **Goal**              | Irrigate 1.2 million acres (â‰ˆ 4,800 kmÂ²) of the Cholistan Desert            |
| **Timeline**          | Construction started Feb 2025 â†’ completion targeted 2030                   |
| **Cost**              | $783 million (â‰ˆ Rs 218 billion)                                            |

### 2. The Promiseâ€”Why Islamabad Says â€œBuild Itâ€

- **Food Security:** Add 2.5 million tons of wheat & cotton annually, cutting $1 billion import bill.
- **Export Boost:** Projected $25â€“35 billion textile export revenue.
- **Job Creation:** 200,000 direct & 600,000 indirect jobs in South Punjab.
- **Water Source Logic:** 4 months flood surplus + 8 months regulated releases from Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS).

### 3. The Pushbackâ€”Environmental & Social Fault-Lines

#### ðŸŒŠ Water Wars

| Stakeholder             | Fear                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sindh (Lower Riparian)** | Loss of 70% of its irrigation water; 2.2 million ha delta farmland turning saline |
| **Indus Delta**         | <1 million acre-feet now reach the sea vs 80 million MAF in 1900â€”mangroves & fisheries collapsing |
| **WWF-Pakistan**        | Soil salinisation, biodiversity loss (houbara bustard, caracal)                  |

#### ðŸœï¸ Desert Ecology at Risk

- Endangered species: Chinkara gazelle, desert fox, houbara bustard.
- Groundwater over-pumping feared once surface water proves unreliable.

#### ðŸ—³ï¸ Political Fallout

| Date            | Event                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **13 Mar 2025** | Sindh Assembly passes resolution against GPI                         |
| **10 Apr 2025** | PTI submits resolution in National Assembly demanding CCI review     |
| **End-Apr 2025**| Construction put on hold pending Council of Common Interests (CCI) consensus |

### 4. Governance & Legal Gaps

| Instrument                       | Status                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1991 Water Apportionment Accord** | Mandates 10 MAF downstream Kotriâ€”never enforced                         |
| **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)** | No public EIA released; WWF calls for comprehensive socio-environmental study |
| **CCI Approval**                 | Required for inter-provincial projectsâ€”yet to be tabled               |

### 5. Voices on the Ground

| Who                                  | Quote                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr., activist**  | â€œThis is not a people-centred initiative. Itâ€™s a for-profit scheme for cash-crop irrigation.â€ |
| **Maj-Gen (r) Shahid Nazir, GPI Director-General** | â€œOur top priority is to produce enough wheat domestically.â€                      |
| **Hammad Naqi Khan, WWF-Pakistan**   | â€œLarge-scale irrigation without strategic planning could exacerbate water insecurity.â€ |

### 6. Possible Pathways Forward

| Scenario                  | Likelihood                | Key Actions                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Build (current plan)** | Low without CCI consensus | CCI vote, revised EIA, Sindh compensation package                |
| **Scaled-Back Pilot**     | Medium                    | 200,000 acres only, smart irrigation (drip, solar pumps)         |
| **Halt & Rethink**        | Rising                    | National water summit, glacier-melt adaptation projects instead  |

### 7. What Citizens Can Do This Week

1.  **Track CCI agenda:** cci.gov.pk
2.  **Join Sindh-Punjab water dialogues:** #SaveIndusDelta Twitter Spaces every Friday
3.  **Offset water footprint:** Install low-flow taps (cuts household use 30%)

*â€œThe canal is a straw in a river thatâ€™s already gasping. If we sip without measuring, we may drown the deltaâ€”and with it, millions of livelihoods.â€*
