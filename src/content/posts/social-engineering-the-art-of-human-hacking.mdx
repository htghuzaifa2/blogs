## Introduction: The Weakest Link
<p>Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. It's a psychological hack, not a technical one, and it's responsible for over 90% of successful cyber attacks.</p>

### The Psychology of Deception
<p>Attackers exploit fundamental human tendencies like reciprocity, authority, and scarcity to build trust and create a sense of urgency.</p>
      
### Common Attack Vectors
<ul>
  <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> The most common vector, using fraudulent emails to steal credentials. <strong>Spear phishing</strong> targets specific individuals with highly personalized messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Pretexting:</strong> Creating an invented scenario (the pretext) to gain information, like an attacker pretending to be from IT support.</li>
  <li><strong>Baiting:</strong> Leaving a malware-infected USB drive labeled "Confidential" in a public place.</li>
</ul>
