*(Updated 18 August 2025 | Covers Sole Proprietorships, Private Limited Companies & SMCs)*

### Step 1: Choose Your Business Structure [2][8][10]

| Type                     | Minimum Members | Liability | Best For                             |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| Sole Proprietorship      | 1               | Unlimited | Freelancers, small retailers         |
| Single Member Co. (SMC)  | 1               | Limited   | Solo founders seeking asset protection|
| Private Limited Co. (Pvt Ltd) | 2+              | Limited   | Startups with co-founders/investors |
| LLP                      | 2+              | Limited   | Professional services firms          |

**Critical Note**: SMCs/Pvt Ltds require SECP registration; sole proprietorships skip SECP but need local municipal licenses [8][10].

### Step 2: Reserve Your Company Name via SECP eServices [2][6][10]

**Check Availability**:

-   Use SECP Name Search Tool → Enter 3 name options (e.g., "TechGenius Pvt Ltd").
-   Avoid banned words ("Bank," "Federal") and ensure alignment with business activities [2][7].

**Pay Fee**: ₨ 1,000 online (₨ 2,000 offline) via JazzCash/credit card [2][10].
**Validity**: Name reserved for 90 days [2].

### Step 3: Prepare Incorporation Documents [2][5][10]

| Document                       | Requirement                               | Template Source                     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Memorandum of Association (MoA) | Business objectives, scope, capital structure | SECP website [2]                    |
| Articles of Association (AoA)  | Internal governance, director roles       | SECP editable templates [2]         |
| CNIC/Passport Copies           | All directors/shareholders (scanned, attested) | —                                   |
| Proof of Registered Office     | Utility bill/lease agreement + property tax slip | —                                   |
| Digital Signatures             | Obtain via NIFT for directors (₨ 1,500/person) | [2][6]                              |

### Step 4: Submit Online Application via SECP eServices [2][6][10]

**Log In**: `eservices.secp.gov.pk` → Use OTP from CNIC-linked mobile.

**Upload**:

-   MoA, AoA, CNICs, address proof, name reservation certificate.
-   Auto-generated Form 1 (compliance), Form 21 (address), Form 29 (director details) [2][6].

**Pay Incorporation Fee**:

-   SMC: ₨ 2,000–₨ 20,000 (based on capital)
-   Pvt Ltd: ₨ 3,000–₨ 30,000 [8][10].

### Step 5: Receive Certificate of Incorporation [2][6][10]

-   **Download**: From eServices portal or collect at SECP office (e.g., Lahore: 3rd Floor, Associated House) [5][10].

### Step 6: Post-Registration Compliance [2][7][10]

**NTN Registration**:

-   Apply via FBR IRIS Portal → Upload incorporation certificate → Get NTN in 48 hours [7][10].

**Open Bank Account**:

-   Required: NTN + incorporation certificate + board resolution [7][10].

**Sales Tax Registration**:

-   Mandatory if revenue > ₨ 10M/year; apply via FBR portal [10].

**Annual SECP Filings**:

-   Submit financial statements by September 30 yearly [10].

### Fee Structure 2025 [2][8][10]

| Service               | SMC Fee (PKR)     | Pvt Ltd Fee (PKR) |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Name Reservation      | ₨ 1,000           | ₨ 1,000           |

| Fast Track (4 hrs)    | ₨ 5,000           | ₨ 5,000           |

### Critical Warnings & Pro Tips [2][8][10]

-   **Deadlines**: Complete NTN/bank account within 30 days of incorporation to avoid penalties.
-   **Scam Alert**: Never pay "agents" for SECP submissions—use only the eServices portal.

-   **Common Rejections**:
    -   Mismatched CNIC addresses → Attach utility bill in director’s name.
    -   "Generic name" (e.g., "Pakistan Solutions") → Add unique keywords ("AlphaLogix").
