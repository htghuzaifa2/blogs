**Special Equipment**: Wok (karahi) or heavy-bottomed pan

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Chicken Prep (5 mins)
Cut chicken into 2.5" pieces (⚠️ bone-in for flavor).
**Pro Tip**: Pat dry with paper towels → ensures searing, not steaming.

#### 2. Tempering Spices (2 mins)
Heat mustard oil in karahi until smoking → cools slightly (removes bitterness).
Add cumin seeds → sizzle 10 secs.
Add ginger-garlic paste → stir 30 secs until golden.

#### 3. Chicken Sear (5 mins)
Add chicken → sear on HIGH heat 5 mins (no stirring!) until edges brown.
Sprinkle turmeric + salt → mix once.

#### 4. Tomato Blast (8 mins)
Add chopped tomatoes, coriander stems, 4 green chilies, coriander powder, red chili powder.
**CRITICAL**: Cook on MAX heat → stir vigorously until tomatoes disintegrate into thick paste (⚠️ no water added!).
Oil should separate around edges.

#### 5. Spice Fusion (10 mins)
Reduce heat to medium → cover → cook 10 mins (chicken releases juices).
Uncover → crank heat back to HIGH.
Add garam masala + lemon juice → stir-fry 2 mins until oil resurfaces.

#### 6. Finish Like a Dhaba (3 mins)
Add:
- Remaining green chilies
- Coriander leaves (reserve some for garnish)
- Ginger juliennes

Stir 60 secs → turn off heat.
Rest 5 mins (essential for flavor infusion).

### Restaurant Secrets Revealed

- **Tomato Trick**: Use slightly unripe tomatoes for tanginess → balances richness.
- **Heat Control**:
  - First 10 mins: Volcano heat (caramelizes tomatoes)
  - Middle: Steam tenderize (covered)
  - Finale: Inferno finish (locks flavors)
- **Mustard Oil**: Non-negotiable for authentic aroma (substitute: 2 tbsp butter + vegetable oil).
- **Coriander Stems**: Chop finely → add early → release earthy depth.

### Serving Ritual
Transfer to karahi dish → garnish with:
- Fresh coriander
- Ginger juliennes
- Extra green chilies

Pair With:
- Garlic naan or rumali roti
- Onion rings + lemon wedges
- Mint raita (yogurt with mint + roasted cumin)

> "Perfect karahi oil should pool crimson-red at the edges—the spice stain of honor!"

**Note**: Gravy clings to chicken—never watery!
