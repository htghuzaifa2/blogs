One of the most common issues after installing Arch Linux — especially on laptops — is that Wi-Fi doesn’t work after your first boot. Don’t worry — this is easy to fix once you understand what’s missing.

This guide covers everything you need to get your Wi-Fi working again, including:

*   Enabling NetworkManager
*   Installing wireless drivers and firmware
*   Diagnosing adapter issues
*   Setting up Wi-Fi manually

Let’s get started. 🧠

🧩 Step 1: Check if NetworkManager Is Installed

Arch doesn’t install everything automatically — you must ensure NetworkManager is present.

Run:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu networkmanager
```
If it says “up to date,” good. Otherwise, it will install it.

Now enable it to start at boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
```

Check its status:
```bash
systemctl status NetworkManager
```
✅ If you see `active (running)` — your service is fine.

📡 Step 2: Detect Your Wireless Adapter

Let’s confirm your system can detect your Wi-Fi card.

Run:
```bash
lspci | grep -i network
```
or, for USB adapters:
```bash
lsusb
```
You’ll see something like:
`Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 8265 / 8275`

If you see no output, your system isn’t detecting your adapter → skip to Step 5 (drivers).

🛰️ Step 3: Check Wi-Fi Interface Availability

Now, verify your wireless interface:
```bash
ip link
```
You should see something like `wlan0` or `wlp2s0`.

If you see it but Wi-Fi still doesn’t show up in the menu:
Your driver is loaded, but NetworkManager may need a restart:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```
If the interface doesn’t appear, go to Step 5.

🧰 Step 4: Connect to Wi-Fi via Terminal (Temporary Fix)

If you have no GUI yet, use `nmcli` (command-line tool for NetworkManager):

List available Wi-Fi networks:
```bash
nmcli dev wifi list
```
Connect:
```bash
nmcli dev wifi connect "Your_WiFi_Name" password "YourPassword"
```
If successful, you’ll see:
`Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with UUID ...`

To test connectivity:
```bash
ping -c 4 archlinux.org
```
If you get responses — you’re online ✅

🧩 Step 5: Install Missing Wi-Fi Drivers

Most laptops need proprietary drivers or firmware.

Run this to install the most common packages:
```bash
sudo pacman -S linux-firmware
```
Then reboot:
```bash
sudo reboot
```
Still not working? Identify your card and install the proper driver.

**🔹 Intel Wi-Fi:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S iwd
sudo systemctl enable iwd
sudo systemctl start iwd
```
**🔹 Broadcom (common on Dell/HP):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S broadcom-wl-dkms
sudo modprobe wl
```
**🔹 Realtek (USB adapters, budget laptops):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S rtl88xxau-dkms
```
(You may need the `base-devel` package to build DKMS drivers)

**🔹 AUR Alternative:**
If you have no Ethernet, connect your phone via USB tethering, then:
```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
yay -S rtl8821ce-dkms
```

🧠 Step 6: Verify Kernel Module Is Loaded

After installing drivers, check:
```bash
sudo lshw -C network
```
or
```bash
sudo dmesg | grep wlan
```
If you see your adapter initialized, it means the driver is loaded successfully.

🧾 Step 7: Enable Wi-Fi Auto-Connection

To make sure Wi-Fi reconnects automatically on boot:
```bash
nmcli connection modify "Your_WiFi_Name" connection.autoconnect yes
```

💡 Step 8: Install a GUI Network Tool (Optional)

If you’re using a desktop environment like KDE, GNOME, or XFCE, make sure you have the network applet installed:

**KDE Plasma:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S plasma-nm
```
**XFCE:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S network-manager-applet
```
**GNOME:**
Already included with `gnome-control-center`.

Reboot and check your Wi-Fi icon — it should show available networks.

⚠️ Step 9: Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem                         | Solution                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wi-Fi disappears after suspend  | `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager`                                                              |
| “No Wi-Fi Adapter Found”        | Reinstall firmware or kernel modules                                                                 |
| No wireless extensions found    | Run `rfkill unblock wifi`                                                                            |
| Can’t detect 5GHz networks      | Ensure regdom is set: `sudo iw reg set PK`                                                             |

🧰 Step 10: Advanced Debugging

If still broken, run:
```bash
dmesg | grep wifi
```
and check errors like:
`firmware: failed to load iwlwifi-7265D-29.ucode`

Then manually install the missing firmware via:
```bash
sudo pacman -S linux-firmware
```
or download it from https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git

🔄 Quick Summary

✅ Ensure NetworkManager is installed and enabled
✅ Install `linux-firmware` and the right Wi-Fi driver
✅ Use `nmcli` or GUI to connect
✅ Reboot — your Wi-Fi should now work permanently

💬 Bonus Tip

Once connected, update your system to ensure you always have the latest driver patches:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

✨ Conclusion

Fixing Wi-Fi on Arch Linux may seem intimidating, but once you understand the system services, it becomes simple.

Arch gives you full control — meaning you manage everything, including drivers. Once set up, your Wi-Fi will work smoothly across reboots.
