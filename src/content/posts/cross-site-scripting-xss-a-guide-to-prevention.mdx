## Introduction: The Trust Betrayal
<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into a web page viewed by other users. The attack exploits the trust a user has in a website.</p>
      
### Types of XSS Attacks
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stored XSS:</strong> The malicious script is permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a comment section). This is the most dangerous type.</li>
  <li><strong>Reflected XSS:</strong> The script is "reflected" off a web server, usually via a malicious link.</li>
  <li><strong>DOM-Based XSS:</strong> The attack happens entirely on the client-side by manipulating the DOM.</li>
</ul>

### The Definitive Prevention Strategy
<p>The golden rule is to <strong>never trust user-provided data</strong>. Escape all user-provided data before rendering it in HTML. Most modern frameworks (React, Vue) do this automatically.</p>
      
<div className="italic text-center text-muted-foreground pt-4 border-t mt-8">
  Reflected, stored, or in the DOM,<br/>
  Encode the output, keep your users calm.
</div>
