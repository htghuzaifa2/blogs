(with the honesty of a friend who’ll steal your fries but also guard your wallet)

I walked the halls of Hafeez Centre, scrolled through Daraz till my thumb cramped, and asked shopkeepers “kya mileage bhai?” so you don’t have to. Below are five phones that actually deserve your forty thousand—no PR poetry, just street-level truth.

### Infinix Hot 40 Pro

*   **Price:** ≈ 35,999
*   **Battery:** 5000 mAh, 33W charger (zero to hero in 75 min)
*   **Camera:** 108 MP main + 32 MP selfie—daylight shots pop, night shots need a street-light friend
*   **Performance:** Helio G99, smooth for PUBG on Medium, heats a bit if you push graphics
*   **Pros:** big 120 Hz screen, loud dual speakers, charger in box
*   **Cons:** IPS screen (no AMOLED), plastic back creaks if you squeeze like a stress ball
*   **Verdict:** selfie king/queen on a budget; aunties approve the pore-detailing.

### Tecno Spark 30 Pro

*   **Price:** ≈ 37,999
*   **Battery:** same 5000 mAh, same 33W speed
*   **Camera:** 108 MP main, 13 MP selfie—colours are vibrant, skin looks like it drank a smoothie
*   **Performance:** Helio G99 again, but software is lighter—feels snappier, less bloat
*   **Pros:** 6.78" 120 Hz screen, stereo speakers that actually stereo, clean UI
*   **Cons:** macro lens is filler, no IR blaster (can’t prank ACs)
*   **Verdict:** Netflix-binge champion; speakers louder than a qawwali speaker on half-volume.

### Redmi 13 4G

*   **Price:** ≈ 36,999
*   **Battery:** 5000 mAh, 33W, zero-to-full in 80 min
*   **Camera:** 108 MP main, 13 MP selfie—colours look natural, night mode behaves
*   **Performance:** Snapdragon 685—cooler gaming, better update roadmap, PUBG stays smooth longer
*   **Pros:** IR blaster (become AC remote hero), AMOLED-screen option (spend +2k extra), reliable updates
*   **Cons:** selfie cam weaker than Infinix, MIUI ads unless you switch them off
*   **Verdict:** gamer’s pick; processor stays cooler than a Lahore winter morning.

### Samsung Galaxy A05s

*   **Price:** ≈ 38,499
*   **Battery:** 5000 mAh, 15W charger (slow but steady—like filling a tank with a drip)
*   **Camera:** 50 MP main, 13 MP selfie—colours look like real life, not Instagram filter
*   **Performance:** Snapdragon 680, 4 GB RAM—day-to-day smooth, heavy games on Low
*   **Pros:** Samsung reliability, 4 years security updates, AMOLED display
*   **Cons:** 15W charger feels like watching paint dry, macro lens is decorative
*   **Verdict:** if you trust brands like you trust nani’s haldi, this is your safety blanket.

### Itel S24

*   **Price:** ≈ 32,999
*   **Battery:** 5000 mAh, 18W—charges while you eat biryani, ready before dessert
*   **Camera:** 108 MP main, 8 MP selfie—daylight crisp, night acceptable if you stand near bulbs
*   **Performance:** UniSoc Tiger T616—fine for calls, YouTube, light games; don’t push PUBG beyond Medium
*   **Pros:** cheapest 108 MP, light in pocket and on pocket, dual speakers
*   **Cons:** plastic build creaks, software updates slower than a rickshaw in traffic
*   **Verdict:** tightest budget hero; performs like a student who studies only the night before—passes, but barely.

#### Where to buy without the “kya network hai?” drama:

*   **PriceOye.pk** – official warranty, box-packed, delivered to your door.
*   **HumariWeb Shop** – PTA-approved stock, prices updated daily.
*   **Al-Fatah Electronics (Lahore) or Mobile Mall (Karachi)** – walk in, touch, haggle, walk out with phone and receipt.

Golden rule: demand PTA-approved box, check IMEI on PTA site before payment, keep receipt like it’s your nikah-nama.

**Eco-tip while you shop:** pick the phone you’ll keep for 3+ years—less e-waste than yearly “pocket lottery”. Sell old device on Cashify.pk or Hamza.pk—someone’s backup = planet’s relief.

#### Quick decision tree:

*   **Selfie king/queen** → Infinix Hot 40 Pro
*   **Gaming + cooler chip** → Redmi 13 4G
*   **Samsung fan + long updates** → Galaxy A05s
*   **Tightest budget but 108 MP** → Itel S24
*   **Netflix-binge + stereo** → Tecno Spark 30 Pro

Final byte: under 40K in 2025 is no longer “compromise city”—108 MP cameras, 120 Hz screens, 5G-ready chips are standard street fare. Pick the flaw you can live with, pay the price that lets you sleep, and remember: a phone is a tool, not a trophy. If it calls, clicks, and doesn’t crash, it already beats the “I’ll buy later” dream.

Happy hunting, may your signal bars stay high and your EMI stay low.
