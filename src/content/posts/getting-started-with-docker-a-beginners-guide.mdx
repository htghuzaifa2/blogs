## Introduction: The "It Works on My Machine" Problem
<p>Docker solves the problem of applications breaking when moved between environments. It does this by packaging an application and all its dependencies into a single, isolated unit called a <strong>container</strong>.</p>

### Containers vs. Virtual Machines
<p>Unlike VMs which virtualize hardware and run a full guest OS, containers virtualize the OS itself. They share the host system's kernel, making them incredibly lightweight, fast, and efficient.</p>
      
### The Core Components of Docker
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dockerfile:</strong> A text file blueprint for building a Docker image.</li>
  <li><strong>Docker Image:</strong> A standalone, executable package containing everything needed to run an application.</li>
  <li><strong>Docker Container:</strong> A running instance of a Docker image.</li>
</ul>
