*(Updated 18 August 2025 | Covers Digital Portals, Legal Routes & Evidence Protocols)*

### Legal Framework & Challenges

- **Pervasive Corruption**: 41.4% of Pakistanis rank police as the "most corrupt" sector, with bribery, custodial killings, and evidence tampering as key issues [4][8].
- **Political Interference**: Officers often act under pressure from "wealthy landowners, politicians, or military elites" [8][9].
- **2022 Torture Law**: Coerced confessions are now inadmissible in court, with offenders facing fines up to Rs100,000 [4].

### Digital Complaint Systems

**1. IGP Complaint Portals (Province-Specific)**

| Province          | Portal/Link                     | Key Features                                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Punjab            | SMS Complaint System            | Text complaints to 8785; track via token number [9]              |
| Sindh             | IGP Complaint Management System | Online FIR disputes, bribery reports, illegal detention claims [6] |
| Khyber Pakhtunkhwa| Online Complaint Form           | Category-based submissions (e.g., "false FIR," "corrupt practices") [11] |
| Islamabad         | Central Police Office Database  | Email/fax/SMS complaints logged with digital evidence [9]        |

**2. National Citizen Portals**

- **Helpline 1099**: Ministry of Human Rights hotline for torture/extralegal killings [4].
- **NAB (National Accountability Bureau)**: For corruption exceeding Rs500 million; email `complaints@nab.gov.pk` [4][9]. Limited for routine misconduct.
- **PM Citizen Portal**: Escalates unresolved cases to federal oversight [9].

### Ombudsman & Judicial Routes

**A. Provincial Ombudsman (Mohtasib)**

- **Jurisdiction**: Investigates delays, negligence, or abuse by police [4].
- **Process**: 1. File written complaint with evidence at regional office. 2. Hearing scheduled within 14 days. 3. Binding recommendations issued.
- **Limitation**: Cannot prosecute; forwards criminal cases to NAB/FIA [9].

**B. Sessions Court FIR Petition**

- **Section 22-A CrPC**: Directly petition judge if police refuse FIR registration [8].
- **Success Rate**: 68% of petitions result in court-ordered FIRs in Punjab (2024 data) [8].

### Critical Scenarios & Responses

| Misconduct Type          | Action                                        | Evidence Needed                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| FIR Non-Registration     | 1. SMS IGP portal. 2. File Section 22-A petition | Witness affidavits, written complaint copy           |
| Custodial Torture        | 1. Call 1099. 2. Medical report within 24hr. 3. File Ombudsman case | Medical certificate, photos/videos [4]              |
| Bribery Demand           | 1. Secretly record interaction. 2. Submit via IGP portal with transaction ID | Audio/video recording, mobile money receipt          |
| False "Encounter" Killing| 1. Report to Human Rights Commission. 2. File FIR under Sec. 302 PPC | Autopsy report, eyewitnesses [8]                     |

### Risks & Precautions

- **Witness Protection**: Use encrypted apps (Signal/Telegram) to share evidence; avoid police station visits alone [8].
- **Retaliation Tactics**: Police may threaten counter-FIRs””preemptively file complaint paper trail [9].
- **Deadlines**: Report custodial violence within 48 hours for admissible medical evidence.

### Evidence Checklist

- **Digital**: Timestamped photos/videos, call recordings, SMS screenshots.
- **Forensic**: Medical certificates (govt. hospital only), autopsy reports.
- **Documentary**: FIR copies, bribe payment receipts, witness affidavits (notarized).
- **Corroborative**: Match injuries with torture tools (littar marks, roola fractures) [8].

### Pro Tips for 2025

- **Track Complaints**: For IGP portals, SMS `STATUS <token>` to `9966` [6][11].
- **Escalate Strategically**: If no response in 7 days, forward portal receipt to:
    - Provincial Home Secretary
    - UNODC Pakistan (`islamabad.office@unodc.org`) [13]
- **NGO Support**: HRCP or Transparency International Pakistan offer free legal aid for high-risk cases [4][8].

### One-Screen Action Plan

1.  **Collect Evidence**: Record bribe/torture; preserve medical/financial docs.
2.  **File Digitally**:
    -   IGP portal (province-specific)
    -   OR SMS `8785` (Punjab)/`1099` (national).
3.  **Escalate If Ignored**:
    -   Ombudsman complaint â†’ Sessions Court petition.
4.  **Protect Yourself**:
    -   Share evidence via encrypted channels.
    -   Avoid police station visits alone.
