Below are 50 field-tested modules you can mix-and-match like LEGO bricks.
Each idea fits on one A5 page, needs nothing fancier than a ball-point, and can be migrated monthly if love fades.

### I. The Daily Grain

#### Quick-Start Micro-Guide

- Pick ONE idea from Daily + ONE from Weekly.
- Draw with pen you already own; perfection is procrastination in a tuxedo.
- Migrate unfinished tasks—never copy guilt, only intention.
- Review every Sunday night; light a candle, play lo-fi, treat it like a date with yourself.
- After 30 days, keep what sparks, bin what drags; your journal is a garden, not a graveyard.

May your dots become constellations that navigate you through the beautiful chaos of being alive.
