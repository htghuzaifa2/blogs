### 👨‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Marinate Mutton (Night Before)
Mix all marinade ingredients → coat mutton thoroughly.
Cover → refrigerate (⚠️ Papaya paste breaks down collagen).

#### 2. Brown Mutton (20 mins)
Heat ¼ cup ghee in heavy pot → sear mutton on HIGH 5 mins/side until caramelized.
Remove → set aside.

#### 3. Build Masala (15 mins)
Same pot → add remaining ghee.
Fry 1.5 cups fried onions → stir in marinated mutton.
Cook 10 mins → add ½ cup water → cover → simmer 45 mins until meat is 80% tender.
⚠️ Add potatoes now if using.

#### 4. Prepare Rice
Wash rice → soak 30 mins → drain.
Boil water with whole spices → add rice → cook until 50% done (grain snaps when bent).
Drain → spread on tray → sprinkle 2 tbsp ghee to prevent sticking.

#### 5. Layering (The Art)
1.  **Base**: Spread mutton masala + potatoes
2.  **Herb Layer**: ½ mint + ½ coriander + green chilies
3.  **Onion Layer**: ½ fried onions
4.  **Rice Layer**: Cover with 50% rice
5.  **Perfume**: Drizzle ½ saffron milk + kewra + rose water
6.  **Repeat**: Herbs → onions → rice → saffron mix
7.  **Seal**: Cover with foil + tight lid (dough seal for perfect *dum*)

#### 6. Dum Cooking (Magic Steam)
Cook on LOW heat 35 mins →
Turn off → rest 20 mins (⚠️ NO PEEKING - steam builds flavor).
**Pro Tip:** Place tawa/griddle under pot for even heat.

### 🌟 Traditional Techniques

#### Mutton Mastery:
- Use shoulder cuts (fat marbling prevents dryness)
- Double sear: Before AND after marination for crust

#### Rice Perfection:
- Aged basmati only (new rice turns mushy)
- Vinegar soak: 1 tbsp in boiling water for pearly grains

#### Dum Secrets:
- Coal smoking: Place live coal in foil cup on biryani → add ghee → cover (adds smokiness)
- Weighted lid: Place heavy object on lid (e.g., mortar)

### 🍽️ Serving Ritual
Gently mix layers → garnish with:
- Reserved fried onions
- Fresh mint/coriander
- Edible silver leaf (optional)

**Accompaniments:**
- Mirchi ka salan (chili curry)
- Boondi raita
- Kachumber salad (cucumber-tomato-onion)
