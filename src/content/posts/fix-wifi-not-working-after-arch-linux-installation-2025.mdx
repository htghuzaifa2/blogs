# How to Fix: Wi-Fi Not Working After Arch Linux Installation (2025 Guide)

One of the most common issues after installing Arch Linux "” especially on laptops "” is that Wi-Fi doesn"™t work after your first boot. Don"™t worry "” this is easy to fix once you understand what"™s missing.

This guide covers everything you need to get your Wi-Fi working again, including:

-   Enabling NetworkManager
-   Installing wireless drivers and firmware
-   Diagnosing adapter issues
-   Setting up Wi-Fi manually

Let"™s get started.

## Step 1: Check if NetworkManager Is Installed

Arch doesn"™t install everything automatically "” you must ensure NetworkManager is present.

Run:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu networkmanager
```

If it says "up to date," good. Otherwise, it will install it.

Now enable it to start at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
```

Check its status:

```bash
systemctl status NetworkManager
```

If you see `active (running)` "” your service is fine.

## Step 2: Detect Your Wireless Adapter

Let"™s confirm your system can detect your Wi-Fi card.

Run:

```bash
lspci | grep -i network
```

or, for USB adapters:

```bash
lsusb
```

You"™ll see something like:

`Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 8265 / 8275`

If you see no output, your system isn"™t detecting your adapter â†’ skip to Step 5 (drivers).

## Step 3: Check Wi-Fi Interface Availability

Now, verify your wireless interface:

```bash
ip link
```

You should see something like `wlan0` or `wlp2s0`.

If you see it but Wi-Fi still doesn"™t show up in the menu: Your driver is loaded, but NetworkManager may need a restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

If the interface doesn"™t appear, go to Step 5.

## Step 4: Connect to Wi-Fi via Terminal (Temporary Fix)

If you have no GUI yet, use `nmcli` (command-line tool for NetworkManager):

List available Wi-Fi networks:

```bash
nmcli dev wifi list
```

Connect:

```bash
nmcli dev wifi connect "Your_WiFi_Name" password "YourPassword"
```

If successful, you"™ll see:

`Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with UUID ...`

To test connectivity:

```bash
ping -c 4 archlinux.org
```

If you get responses "” you"™re online âœ…

## Step 5: Install Missing Wi-Fi Drivers

Most laptops need proprietary drivers or firmware.

Run this to install the most common packages:

```bash
sudo pacman -S linux-firmware
```

Then reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Still not working? Identify your card and install the proper driver.

### Intel Wi-Fi:

```bash
sudo pacman -S iwd
sudo systemctl enable iwd
sudo systemctl start iwd
```

### Broadcom (common on Dell/HP):

```bash
sudo pacman -S broadcom-wl-dkms
sudo modprobe wl
```

### Realtek (USB adapters, budget laptops):

```bash
sudo pacman -S rtl88xxau-dkms
```

(You may need the `base-devel` package to build DKMS drivers)

### AUR Alternative:

If you have no Ethernet, connect your phone via USB tethering, then:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
yay -S rtl8821ce-dkms
```

## Step 6: Verify Kernel Module Is Loaded

After installing drivers, check:

```bash
sudo lshw -C network
```

or

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep wlan
```

If you see your adapter initialized, it means the driver is loaded successfully.

## Step 7: Enable Wi-Fi Auto-Connection

To make sure Wi-Fi reconnects automatically on boot:

```bash
nmcli connection modify "Your_WiFi_Name" connection.autoconnect yes
```

## Step 8: Install a GUI Network Tool (Optional)

If you"™re using a desktop environment like KDE, GNOME, or XFCE, make sure you have the network applet installed:

### KDE Plasma:

```bash
sudo pacman -S plasma-nm
```

### XFCE:

```bash
sudo pacman -S network-manager-applet
```

### GNOME:

Already included with `gnome-control-center`.

Reboot and check your Wi-Fi icon "” it should show available networks.

## Step 9: Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem                         | Solution                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Wi-Fi disappears after suspend  | `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager`         |
| "No Wi-Fi Adapter Found"        | Reinstall firmware or kernel modules          |
| No wireless extensions found    | Run `rfkill unblock wifi`                     |
| Can"™t detect 5GHz networks      | Ensure `regdom` is set: `sudo iw reg set PK`  |

## Step 10: Advanced Debugging

If still broken, run:

```bash
dmesg | grep wifi
```

and check errors like:

`firmware: failed to load iwlwifi-7265D-29.ucode`

Then manually install the missing firmware via:

```bash
sudo pacman -S linux-firmware
```

or download it from `https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git`

## Quick Summary

-   âœ… Ensure NetworkManager is installed and enabled
-   âœ… Install `linux-firmware` and the right Wi-Fi driver
-   âœ… Use `nmcli` or GUI to connect
-   âœ… Reboot "” your Wi-Fi should now work permanently

### Bonus Tip

Once connected, update your system to ensure you always have the latest driver patches:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

## Conclusion

Fixing Wi-Fi on Arch Linux may seem intimidating, but once you understand the system services, it becomes simple.

Arch gives you full control "” meaning you manage everything, including drivers. Once set up, your Wi-Fi will work smoothly across reboots.
