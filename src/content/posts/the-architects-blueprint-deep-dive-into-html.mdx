## Introduction: The Invisible Framework
<p>Every website, application, and interactive experience rests upon HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It is not a programming language but the structural skeleton of the web, defining content organization and meaning.</p>

### Anatomy of an HTML Document
<p>An HTML document has a standard structure:</p>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
      
### Semantic HTML: The Key to SEO & Accessibility
<p>HTML5 introduced semantic elements that give meaning to your content, which is crucial for search engines and screen readers.</p>
      
<div className="italic text-center text-muted-foreground pt-4 border-t mt-8">
  In angle brackets, the web is born,<br/>
  The silent skeleton, since the dawn.
</div>
