### 🔪 Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Prep Mince (5 mins)
1.  Spread mince on tray → refrigerate 30 mins (cold meat binds better).
2.  Squeeze chopped onions in cloth → remove all juice (⚠️ prevents sogginess).

#### 2. Spice Mix & Binding (5 mins)
In a bowl, combine:
*   Chilled mince
*   Onion, ginger-garlic paste, chilies, herbs
*   All spices + salt
*   Roasted besan + raw papaya paste

**Critical**: Mix clockwise 5 mins → slap mixture against bowl 20x (develops gluten-like bind).

#### 3. Chill & Skewer (20 mins + chilling)
1.  Cover mixture → refrigerate 2 hours (or freeze 30 mins).
2.  Soak flat skewers in water.
3.  Divide mix into 12 balls → mold onto skewers:
    *   Wet hands → press firmly into 6" cylinders
    *   **Pro Tip**: Leave 2" gap at bottom for handling

#### 4. Smoking Ritual (Dhungar - Optional)
1.  Place kababs in steel bowl.
2.  Heat charcoal piece → place in foil cup → drizzle ghee.
3.  Set cup on kababs → cover 10 mins → infuses smokiness.

#### 5. Grilling (10 mins)
*   **Charcoal grill**: Cook 4" above medium coals → rotate every 2 mins until charred spots appear.
*   **Stovetop**: Use grill pan → brush oil → cook on medium-high.
*   **Oven**: Broil 8 mins at 230°C (446°F), flipping once.
*   **Doneness Test**: Internal temp 74°C (165°F) – juices run clear.

### 🌟 Pro Secrets for Juicy Kababs

*   **Fat Ratio**: 80:20 meat-to-fat → renders juiciness. **Hack**: Add 2 tbsp grated frozen beef fat if using lean meat.
*   **Binding Science**:
    *   Besan: Absorbs moisture → prevents crumbling.
    *   Papaya Paste: Enzymes break proteins → tenderizes.
*   **Chilling Magic**: Cold meat → firm texture → holds skewer.
*   **Smoke Trick**: Add clove-studded onion to charcoal for aromatic smoke.

### 🍽️ Serving Ritual
Slide off skewers → garnish with:
*   Lemon wedges
*   Onion rings (tossed with chaat masala)
*   Mint chutney

Pair With:
*   Roomali roti or naan
*   Raita (whisked yogurt + roasted cumin)
*   Sliced cucumbers
