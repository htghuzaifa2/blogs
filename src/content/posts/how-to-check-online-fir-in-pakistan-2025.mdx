Justice starts with transparency. In the past, verifying a First Information Report (FIR) meant navigating a maze of paperwork and visiting crowded police stations. In 2025, Pakistan has taken a massive step toward "Digital Policing." Today, whether you are in Lahore, Karachi, or Islamabad, your legal records are just one CNIC number away.

This digital shift doesn't just save time; it ensures accountability. Being able to verify the details of an FIR independently is a vital right for every citizen. Today, I”™m breaking down the official channels for Punjab, Sindh, and the Capital territory so you can access your records with ease.

Online verification is more than just a convenience; it”™s a security feature.
