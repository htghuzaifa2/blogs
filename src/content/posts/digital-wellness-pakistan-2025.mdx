> “Your screen is a mirror. Polish it with intention, not compulsion.”

Pakistan’s smartphone penetration crossed 99 % in 2024 and average daily screen time now tops 8.5 hours for 18–30-year-olds. While connectivity empowers, anxiety, depression, and insomnia are rising sharply. Below is a Pakistan-specific survival guide to stay mentally fit without unplugging completely.

### 5-Step Digital Wellness Plan (No Money Needed)

#### 1. Micro-Detox (2-Week Starter)

Rule: Limit non-work screen time to 90 min/day after 7 p.m.
Tool: Use Digital Wellbeing (Android) or Screen Time (iOS) built-in timers.
Result: 2025 trials show statistically significant reductions in anxiety & depression (p < 0.0001) after just 14 days.

#### 2. Mindful Scroll Routine

30-Second Pause: Before opening any app, ask “Why am I here?”
Pakistani Hack: Set Urdu affirmation as lock-screen wallpaper (“Main aaj waqt ka khayal rakhoonga/rahoongi”).

#### 3. Replace Doom-Scroll with Utility-Scroll

| Doom-Scroll App   | Utility Alternative                   | Free |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Instagram Explore | LinkedIn Learning (15-min courses)    | ✅   |

#### 4. Community Detox Challenges

Campus Groups: Form “No-Phone 7–9 p.m.” WhatsApp pledges (ironic but works).
Family Edition: Sunday “Roti & Real Talk”—phones in basket till dinner ends.

#### 5. Sleep Hygiene 2.0

Blue-Light Filter: Enable Night Shift (iOS) or Twilight (Android).
Bedroom Rule: Charge phone outside bedroom—use old-school alarm clock (₨ 300).
