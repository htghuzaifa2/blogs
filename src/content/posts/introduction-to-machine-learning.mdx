Machine Learning (ML) is the engine behind many modern marvels, from recommendation systems to self-driving cars. But what exactly is it? This introductory guide breaks down the fundamental concepts of ML for beginners. We'll explore the main types of machine learning—supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning—and discuss key terms like models, features, and training data. With simple analogies and clear explanations, you'll gain a high-level understanding of how machines can learn from data to make predictions and decisions.
