### ðŸ› ï¸ Diagnose Boot Performance with `systemd-analyze`

Start by understanding where time is being spent during your boot process using these essential commands:

| Command                      | Purpose                  | What It Reveals                                            |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `systemd-analyze time`       | Overall time breakdown   | Firmware, loader, kernel, and userspace boot times         |
| `systemd-analyze blame`      | Service initialization times | All running units ordered by startup time                  |
| `systemd-analyze critical-chain` | Critical path analysis   | Dependency chain showing what delays graphical/multi-user target |
| `systemd-analyze plot > boot.svg` | Visual boot timeline   | Graphical representation of entire boot process            |

Example output interpretation:
```bash
Startup finished in 8.075s (firmware) + 3.495s (loader) + 1.414s (kernel) + 1min 30.309s (userspace) = 1min 43.295s
```
This shows the **userspace** phase is the main bottleneck at 1 minute 30 seconds.

### ðŸš€ Common Slow Boot Issues and Solutions

#### Service Conflicts and Timeouts

*   **Multiple Network Managers**: Having conflicting services like `systemd-networkd`, `iwd`, `dhcpcd`, and `netctl` enabled simultaneously causes delays. Choose one and disable the others.
*   **Slow Services**: Use `systemd-analyze blame` to identify services taking excessive time. Consider delaying non-essential services or using socket activation.

#### Socket Activation for Heavy Services

For services like Docker that significantly impact boot time, replace direct service startup with socket activation:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable docker.service
sudo systemctl enable docker.socket
```
This starts Docker only when first needed, removing it from the critical boot path. One user reported boot time reduction from 68 seconds to 28 seconds using this method.

#### Hardware-Specific Issues

*   **Slow Kernel Time**: If the kernel phase takes >10 seconds (like 33s in one case), this may indicate storage or hardware issues. Check for AMD GPU timeout messages or storage controller problems in `journalctl` logs.
*   **Wait for Network**: Services like `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service` can delay boot. Consider if your system truly needs full network connectivity before boot completion.

### ðŸ“‹ Optimization Checklist

Apply these additional optimizations for better boot performance:

1.  **Review Enabled Services**: Disable unnecessary services with `systemctl disable service.name`
2.  **Kernel Parameters**: Add `libahci.ignore_sss=1` to disable staggered spin-up on some hardware.
3.  **Filesystem Mount Options**: Use `noauto,x-systemd.automount` for non-critical filesystems like `/home` to mount on first access.
4.  **Initramfs Optimization**: Consider slimmer alternatives like Booster or `mkinitcpio` with `systemd` hook instead of `base` and `udev`.
5.  **UEFI Firmware**: Update your motherboard BIOS/UEFI, as slow firmware initialization contributes to boot time.

### ðŸ’» Putting It All Together: A Real-World Example

Here's how one user solved their 1 minute 43 second boot time:

1.  **Identified the Culprit**: `systemd-analyze critical-chain` showed `network.target` waiting over a minute.
2.  **Discovered Root Cause**: Multiple conflicting network services (`iwd`, `dhcpcd`, `systemd-networkd`).
3.  **Applied Fix**: Consolidated to a single network management solution.
4.  **Verified Improvement**: Boot time reduced significantly after resolving conflicts.

After applying the relevant optimizations for your system, run `systemd-analyze` again to compare results. Most systems can achieve 15-30 second boot times with proper tuning.

If you're still experiencing specific issues after trying these steps, please share your `systemd-analyze` output, and I can provide more targeted advice.
