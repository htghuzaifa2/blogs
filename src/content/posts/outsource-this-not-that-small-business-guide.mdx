“do not outsource the voice that tells the story—
only the chairs the audience sits on.”
—Huzi

Below is a field-tested menu: left column = ship away, right column = clutch tight.
Print it, tape it above your desk, and glance at it every time growth-greed whispers “just let it all go.”

### 1. OUTSOURCE ➜ Bookkeeping & Tax Prep
**Why** | Rules mutate yearly; one wrong decimal can buy you a date with the FBR.
**How** | Hire cloud-based CPA firm (Pakistan avg $150–$300/month for < $500 k revenue).
**Tools** | Xero, QuickBooks, Wise auto-feed.
**Red flag** | If they won’t sign an NDA or give you admin access, walk.

### 2. KEEP ➜ Cash-Flow Oversight
Daily glance at receivables, burn rate, runway—this is the pulse, not the paperwork.
Schedule 15 min every morning; no third-party can feel your oxygen dropping faster than you.

### 3. OUTSOURCE ➜ Payroll Processing
**Why** | Statutory deductions, EOBI, EOBI increases, overtime maths—let robots and nerds handle it.
**Cost** | ~$4–$6 per employee/month locally; cheaper than one penalty.
**Bonus** | Direct deposit saves you a trip to the bank with a suitcase of envelopes (yes, that still happens).

### 4. KEEP ➜ Hiring Decisions
Culture is brewed at the first handshake. Outsource screening, not selection.
Final interview = founder territory; nobody else will guard the cathedral gates with the same ferocity.

### 5. OUTSOURCE ➜ Graphic Design & Brand Collateral
Logos, social posts, packaging—use vetted freelancers (Behance, Dribbble, Facebook group “Pakistani Designers”).
Flat rate: $50 logo, $15 Instagram template pack.
Provide a 3-word mood board (“Sufi-cyber-minimal”) to avoid psychedelic camels.

### 6. KEEP ➜ Brand Voice & Story
The narrative arc—why you exist, why anyone should care—must sweat from your own pores.
Outsource illustration, never genesis.

### 7. OUTSOURCE ➜ Website Development
Custom code, speed optimisation, plugin updates—ship it.
Tip: Hire on retainer ($200/month) for 2 h maintenance; you focus on conversion copy, not CSS tantrums.

### 8. KEEP ➜ Core Product Recipe
Whether it’s nani’s biryani masala ratio or your SaaS algorithm, keep the secret sauce in-house.
NDAs expire; nostalgia doesn’t.

### 9. OUTSOURCE ➜ Customer-Support Tier 1
FAQs, order status, return labels—train a VA team, pay $4/h, run Zendesk macros.
Escalate only anomalies to you.

### 10. KEEP ➜ Customer Apologies & Save-Offers
The moment a complaint crosses the “I’m leaving” threshold, the founder enters—personal email, phone call, refund + gift.
Loyalty is forged in the furnace of recovery.

### 11. OUTSOURCE ➜ Content Editing / Video Cutting
Raw footage ➜ polished Reel in 48 h for $30? Yes.
Provide time-stamps of golden takes; let them splice b-roll of Karachi sunset.

### 12. KEEP ➜ Content Strategy & Calendar
What stories align with Ramadan launch, cricket final, Black-Friday-in-Pakistan? That radar lives inside your skull.

### 13. OUTSOURCE ➜ Digital Ads Management
Google, Meta, TikTok—certified media buyers spend 8 h a day inside dashboards that would melt your eyeballs.
Pay 10 % of ad spend or PKR 50 k flat, whichever higher.

### 14. KEEP ➜ Offer Creation & Pricing Psychology
Only you know the margin, the fear, the urgency.
Outsource the knob-twiddling, not the knob-creation.

### 15. OUTSOURCE ➜ Legal Templates
Terms-of-service, refund policy, vendor agreement—buy from reputable legal-template shop, then customise.
Cost: $99 vs $1,200 bespoke billable hours.

### 16. KEEP ➜ Litigation Decisions
When to fight, when to settle—this is chess, not checkers.
Keep your finger on the king.

### 17. OUTSOURCE ➜ Fulfilment / 3PL
Pick-pack-ship scales linearly; you don’t.
Local 3PL in Karachi & Lahore charges ~PKR 25 per pick + courier cost; frees garage from carton towers.

### 18. KEEP ➜ Unboxing Experience
Tissue colour, thank-you card copy, free sticker—micro-moments that spark UGC.
Visit the warehouse, assemble one prototype box yourself, then hand the SOP to the packers.

### 19. OUTSOURCE ➜ Lead-Gen Cold Calling
Scripted appointment setting for B2B; pay per qualified call ($8–$12).
You close, they prospect.

### 20. KEEP ➜ Investor Relations
Cap-table drama, valuation narrative, exit vision—outsiders can draft decks, but passion must be live-streamed from your pupils.

### 21. OUTSOURCE ➜ Translation & Localization
Urdu, Punjabi, Chinese—native freelancers on Upwork ($0.04/word).
You approve glossary of core terms so “craft” doesn’t become “airplane” in Mandarin.

### 22. KEEP ➜ Company Values Poster
If you can’t write it hung-over at 2 a.m. from memory, it’s not a value—it’s a marketing line.

### 23. OUTSOURCE ➜ Market Research Surveys
Panel providers, SurveyMonkey audience—get 400 responses overnight for $200.
Analyse the crosstabs yourself; insight is born in the questions you ask of the data.

### 24. KEEP ➜ Final Say on Pivot vs Persevere
Only the captain decides when to turn the ship; consultants can read the stars, not feel the leak.

### 25. OUTSOURCE ➜ Cleaning the Office
$80/month for nightly vacuum & trash; never ask your MBA-trained ops manager to unclog the pantry sink.

### 26. KEEP ➜ Decorating the First Office
The colour of the accent wall, the quote by the door—that’s culture wallpaper.
Paint it yourself (or at least hold the brush).

### Cheat-Sheet Summary
**OUTSOURCE** = Repetitive, rule-based, scale-heavy, specialist-tools-required.
**KEEP** = Strategic, values-based, customer-facing at emotional inflection points, or requiring founder authority.

Stick this list inside your journal; update it every quarter.
Outsource wisely, and you’ll buy back time without selling your soul—
a currency that compounds faster than any marketing funnel ever could.

Here’s to working on the circus, not juggling in every tent,
