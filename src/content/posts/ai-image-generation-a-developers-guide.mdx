## Introduction: Creative APIs
<p>The real power of AI image generation for developers lies in using models via APIs to build applications and automate content creation.</p>
      
### Choosing Your Model
<p>The main contenders are OpenAI's DALL-E 3 and the open-source Stable Diffusion. For this guide, we'll use the Replicate API to run Stable Diffusion for its simplicity and flexibility.</p>
      
### Key Parameters
<p>Mastering image generation requires understanding key parameters like `prompt`, `negative_prompt`, `width`, `height`, `guidance_scale`, and `seed` to control the output.</p>
