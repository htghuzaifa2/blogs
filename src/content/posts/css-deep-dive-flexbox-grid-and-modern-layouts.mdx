Gone are the days of hacking layouts with `float`, `clearfix`, and `position: absolute`. Modern CSS gives us two distinct, powerful systems: **Flexbox** and **Grid**.

But which one should you use? The answer is often "both."

## Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layout
Flexbox is designed for laying out items in a **single dimension**—either a row OR a column.
- **Use Case**: Navigation bars, centering items, distributing space between buttons.
- **Key Properties**: `justify-content` (main axis), `align-items` (cross axis).

```css
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Spacing between logo and items */
  align-items: center; /* Vertical centering */
}
```

## CSS Grid: Two-Dimensional Layout
Grid is designed for controlling **both** rows and columns simultaneously. It effectively divides a page into major regions.
- **Use Case**: Entire page layouts (Header, Sidebar, Main Content, Footer), photo galleries.
- **Key Properties**: `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `grid-area`.

```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
}
```
*Note: The snippet above creates a responsive grid that automatically wraps items without needing media queries!*

## When to Use Which?
- **Flexbox**: "Content-first." I have a bunch of items, and I want them to fit into the available space naturally.
- **Grid**: "Layout-first." I have a specific design structure (e.g., 12-column grid), and I want to place items into distinct cells.

## Combining Them
This is the superpower. Use Grid for the overall page structure, and Flexbox for the components *inside* those grid cells.
- A card component inside a Grid cell might use Flexbox to align its icon and text.

## Conclusion
Mastering Flexbox and Grid is non-negotiable for modern frontend developers. They allow you to build complex, responsive interfaces with clean, semantic code.
