## Introduction: Beyond Floats
<p>Modern CSS has given us two revolutionary tools that make layout design intuitive and powerful: <strong>Flexbox</strong> and <strong>Grid</strong>. This guide provides a deep dive into both systems, helping you understand their core philosophies and when to use each.</p>

### Flexbox: The Master of One-Dimensional Alignment
<p>Flexbox is designed for laying out items in a single dimension â€“ either a row or a column. It excels at distributing space and aligning items within a container.</p>

### CSS Grid: The Master of Two-Dimensional Layouts
<p>CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to control both rows and columns simultaneously. It's the most powerful layout system in CSS.</p>
