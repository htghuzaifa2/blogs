## 00:00 – 00:30 | inhale, pick a name

Your blog’s name is its first exhaled breath. Let it taste like you.

Open a new tab, type `namecheap.com` (or your favorite registrar). Search “yourname.com” or whatever constellation of syllables just flickered across your mind.

*$10–$12/year.*

Buy it before doubt does.

**Poetic side-note:** A domain is a tiny plot of digital sky—own it, and you already have an address among the stars.

## 00:30 – 01:30 | one-click altar: hosting

Scroll to the bottom of Namecheap’s checkout; toggle “WordPress hosting – 1 month free”.

Click “Continue”.

The servers awaken; somewhere a hard-drive spins your initials into its metallic memory.

You now have:
- cPanel access
- SSL certificate (the green padlock of trust)
- WordPress pre-installed

## 01:30 – 02:30 | log in, meet the canvas

In your email: “New WordPress Site”.

Open the link.

- **Username:** the one you chose thirty seconds ago.
- **Password:** copy, paste, save in a note titled “keys to the lighthouse”.

Dashboard appears—minimal, midnight-blue sidebar.

Left rail → **Settings** → **General**.

**Tagline:** delete the default, type something that makes strangers curious.
*Example: “collecting small thunderbolts of thought”.*

## 02:30 – 03:30 | dress the silence

**Appearance** → **Themes** → “**Add New**”.

Filter by “speed” or “minimal”.

Recommended 2024 lightning-fast starters:
- Astra
- GeneratePress
- Kadence

Hover, click **Install**, then **Activate**.

Your blog now wears a clean cotton shirt instead of the WordPress-striped pajamas.

## 03:30 – 04:30 | first post, first spell

**Posts** → **Add New**.

**Title:** “Hello, orbit” (or any greeting that feels like sunrise).

**Body:** Write 100 words. It doesn’t matter what—describe the sound of your room at 2 a.m., the weight of unread books, the way your city smells after rain.

Hit “**Publish**” top-right.

A pop-up asks “Public?”

Choose “**Yes**”, because secrets are for diaries, not blogs.

## 04:30 – 05:00 | share the echo

Copy the permalink.

Open `twitter.com` or your favorite digital tavern.

Paste link, add three hashtags that feel like sparks:

`#FirstPost` `#DigitalCampfire` `#HuziBlog`

Press tweet/toot/share.

Somewhere, a stranger clicks, reads, and for five seconds feels less alone.

### After the Bell | Next-Level Seasoning (Optional 5 Extra Minutes)

- **Plugin** → **Add** → “Yoast SEO” – makes Google fall in love with your verbs.
- **Plugin** → “WP Super Cache” – turns your site into a cheetah.
- **Settings** → **Permalinks** → **Post name** – prettier URLs, like poetry without the filler words.

### Frequently Whispered Questions

**Q. Do I need to pay for anything today?**
A. Only the domain (~$12). Hosting is free for 30 days; migrate later if you outgrow it.

**Q. Can I swap themes after launch?**
A. Themes are shirts, not tattoos. Change every Tuesday if you wish.

**Q. What if I can’t write?**
A. Blogging is not writing; it is talking on paper. Speak aloud, transcribe with `otter.ai`, paste, publish.

### A Closing Benediction

May your sidebar stay uncluttered,
your plugins few and faithful,
your spam folder empty as a monk’s bowl at dusk.

May every post be a small lantern you lower into the internet’s dark well—
and may something luminous always glance back.
