## 2. Wellness Architecture: Designing for Focus

You can"™t rely on willpower alone. You must design your environment to support your mind.
-   **Greyscale Mode:** Turn your phone to greyscale. Without the bright, dopamine-triggering colors, your phone becomes a tool instead of a toy.
-   **Notification Fasting:** Set "Do Not Disturb" schedules that align with your deep work hours and your sleep cycle. If it isn't a family emergency, it can wait.

## Conclusion

Pixels fade where soil meets palm. We were not designed to be "Synced" 24/7. In 2025, the greatest luxury is not having more information; it is having the space to think for yourself. Unplug the machine, and reconnect with the human.

Stay present. Stay sharp. Stay Huzi.
