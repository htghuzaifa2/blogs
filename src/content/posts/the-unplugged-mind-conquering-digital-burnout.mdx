      <h2>The Burnout Epidemic: Why Gen Z Can’t Log Off</h2>
      <p>Constant connectivity has birthed a new malaise: digital fatigue. With 72% of Gen Z reporting anxiety from notification overload, 2025’s self-care prioritizes mindful disconnection. Unlike bubble baths, modern mental wellness demands systemic shifts—like "sleepmaxxing" (optimizing sleep cycles) and analog hobbies that anchor us beyond screens.</p>
      <h3>Neuro-Tech: When AI Supports Mental Health</h3>
      <p>Paradoxically, technology now curbs its own harm:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Therapists:</strong> Chatbots like Woebot use CBT techniques to reframe negative thoughts post-workday.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus Tools:</strong> Apps such as Notebook convert study notes into quizzes—slashing revision stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Wellness Architecture:</strong> Smart homes dim lights at 9 PM, nudging toward screen-free wind-downs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Offline Sanctuaries: The Rise of IRL Tribes</h3>
      <p>As virtual fatigue grows, embodied communities thrive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Run Clubs:</strong> Combine movement with social connection—no activity tracking allowed.</li>
        <li><strong>Book Circles:</strong> Physical book swaps with silent reading hours (inspired by Moral Fibres’ emphasis on tactile joy).</li>
        <li><strong>Gardening Co-Ops:</strong> Treading My Own Path’s urban plots teach regenerative rituals.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Your Anti-Burnout Toolkit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Notification Fasting:</strong> Silence apps from 7 PM–7 AM.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensorial Resets:</strong> Diffuse lavender during work blocks; use textured stones for grounding anxiety.</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-Offlining:</strong> 15-minute daily walks—phone left behind.</li>
      </ul>
      <div className="italic text-center text-muted-foreground pt-4 border-t mt-8">
        Pixels fade where soil meets palm,<br/>
        Heartbeats sync to twilight’s calm—<br/>
        In breath, not bytes, we find our name,<br/>
        Unplugged, yet wholly here, again.
      </div>
