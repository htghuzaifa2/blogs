Hollywood depicts hacking as tech magic. A guy types furiously for 10 seconds and says, "I'm in."
Real hacking is 90% research, 9% frustration, and 1% execution.

## The Hacker Mindset
Hacking is not about malice; it's about **curiosity**. A hacker looks at a locked door and doesn't just want to open it; they want to know how the lock mechanism works, who made it, and if it can be opened with a bubblegum wrapper.

## The Spectrum of Hackers

### 1. White Hat (Ethical Hackers)
These are the "good guys." Companies pay them millions to break into their systems.
- **Job Titles**: Penetration Tester, Security Researcher, Red Teamer.
- **Goal**: Find vulnerabilities so they can be fixed *before* bad guys find them.

### 2. Black Hat (Malicious Hackers)
The criminals.
- **Goal**: Profit (Ransomware), espionage, or destruction.
- **M.O.**: They don't follow rules. They will steal your grandma's credit card or shut down a hospital's power grid.

### 3. Grey Hat
The vigilantes. They might hack a company without permission to prove a point, but they don't steal money. They walk a fine legal line.

## Famous Hacks That Changed the World
1.  **Stuxnet (2010)**: A computer worm that physically destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges. It was the first "Cyber Weapon."
2.  **WannaCry (2017)**: Ransomware that locked up 200,000 computers across 150 countries, including the NHS in the UK.

## How to Start?
You don't need a hoodie. You need Linux.
1.  **Learn Linux**: It's the OS of the internet.
2.  **Learn Networking**: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP. How do packets move?
3.  **Learn Coding**: Python and Bash are essential.

## Conclusion
Hacking is a superpower. Like any power, it can be used to build or to destroy. The choice is yours.
