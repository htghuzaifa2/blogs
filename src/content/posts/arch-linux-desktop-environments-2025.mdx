Arch Linux remains a top choice for users who want a customizable, rolling-release distro. Pairing it with the right desktop environment (DE) can make all the difference. In 2025, the key contenders—KDE Plasma, XFCE, and GNOME—have seen updates that improve performance, features, and Wayland compatibility.

The "best" DE depends on your hardware, workflow, and preferences. For low-end systems, XFCE shines. KDE offers unparalleled tweakability, while GNOME provides a polished, app-centric experience.

## KDE Plasma 6.5

KDE Plasma is highly customizable, with widgets, effects, and a vast settings ecosystem. It's great for multitasking with virtual desktops and activities.
-   **Installation:** `pacman -S plasma`
-   **Pros:** Feature-rich, modern, excellent Wayland support.
-   **Cons:** Can have higher resource use if not optimized.

## XFCE 4.20

XFCE is the lightweight champion, offering a classic panel-based interface that's fast and modular. It's ideal for older hardware or users who want a no-frills setup.
-   **Installation:** `pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies`
-   **Pros:** Extremely low resource usage, stable, and responsive.
-   **Cons:** Looks dated without theming.

## GNOME 49

GNOME emphasizes simplicity and productivity with its overview mode, extensions, and touch-friendly design. It's modern and integrates well with apps like Nautilus.
-   **Installation:** `pacman -S gnome`
-   **Pros:** Polished UI, gesture-based workflow, good app integration.
-   **Cons:** Less customizable without extensions, higher RAM usage.

## Benchmark Comparison: RAM and CPU Usage

Recent 2025 benchmarks on Arch-based systems (like Manjaro 24.2.1 and EndeavourOS with kernel 6.12) show XFCE as the most efficient, followed by KDE, with GNOME using the most resources.

| Desktop Environment | Idle RAM | Loaded RAM (4-5 apps) | Idle CPU | Notes / Geekbench Score |
| :------------------ | :------- | :-------------------- | :------- | :---------------------- |
| **KDE Plasma (6.5)**| ~1.4 GB  | ~2.2 - 2.6 GB         | ~20-30%  | Single-core: ~2695      |
| **XFCE (4.20)**     | ~1.1 GB  | ~1.7 - 1.9 GB         | ~20-30%  | Single-core: ~2700      |
| **GNOME (49)**      | ~1.5 GB  | ~2.5 - 3.0 GB         | ~20-30%  | Single-core: ~2645      |

### Key Insights from Benchmarks:

-   **RAM Efficiency:** XFCE consistently uses 200-400 MB less RAM than KDE and GNOME, making it ideal for systems with 4GB RAM or less.
-   **CPU Performance:** Differences are minimal at idle, but XFCE and KDE edge out GNOME in latency tests under load.
-   **Overall Speed:** XFCE feels the fastest subjectively due to its low overhead.

## Recommendation

For Arch Linux in 2025:

-   **Choose XFCE** if you prioritize low resource usage and speed on modest hardware.
-   **Go with KDE Plasma** for feature-packed customization without sacrificing too much performance.
-   **Pick GNOME** for a modern, intuitive interface if you have ample RAM and CPU.

All three install easily on Arch and support the latest features like Wayland. Test them in a live environment or VM to see what fits your setup best.
