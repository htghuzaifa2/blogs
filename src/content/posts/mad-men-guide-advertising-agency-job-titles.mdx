> â€œAdvertising is based on one thing: happiness.
> And you know what happiness is? Happiness is the smell of a new car.â€
> â€”Don Draper, Creative Director, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce

Below is a pocket-sized org-chart of the 1960s Madison Avenue jungleâ€”translated, updated, and lightly perfumed with bourbon and wit.

Whether youâ€™re binge-watching Mad Men for the fourth time or interviewing at a 2025 boutique agency, this lexicon will keep you from calling the Copy Chief â€œthe slogan guy.â€

### 1. Creative Director
**Then (1963)** | Don Draper, hat tilted like a question mark, pitches Kodak while hiding a whole war identity in his desk.
**Now (2025)** | Still the orchestra conductor of ideas, but also the data-whispererâ€”approving TikTok storyboards at 9 a.m., A/B-testing thumb-stoppers at noon.
**Super-power:** Turning â€œI donâ€™t know what I wantâ€ into â€œHereâ€™s the tagline that will tattoo itself on culture.â€

### 2. Copywriter
**Then** | Peggy Olson, fresh from Brooklyn, learns that lipstick is bought by women but sold to men.
**Now** | Writes 6-word push notifications that outperform 30-second TV spots.
**Secret rite:** Every junior copywriter still pins their first live tweet above the deskâ€”digital equivalent of Belle Jolie lipstick copy.

### 3. Art Director
**Then** | Stan Rizzo in sideburns, pasting layouts with rubber cement that smells like adolescence.
**Now** | Designs motion systems in Figma, exports 47 sizes before lunch, still argues about kerning.
**Desk giveaway:** A Pantone chip from 1965 used as a bookmark.

### 4. Account Executive (a.k.a. â€œThe Suitâ€)
**Then** | Pete Campbell, silver-spooned and smirk-powered, lunches at 21 Club on the clientâ€™s dime.
**Now** | Account Manager-slash-therapist, juggling Slack, Zoom, and a client who wants to â€œgo viralâ€ by Thursday.
**KPI:** Keep the client happily ignorant of how the sausage is madeâ€”unless itâ€™s plant-based, because 2025.

### 5. Media Planner / Buyer
**Then** | Hidden in the basement with rate cards and a landline, buying full-pages in Life magazine.
**Now** | Programmatic wizard bidding 0.3Â¢ CPMs in real time while Spotify hums lo-fi beats.
**Addiction:** Dashboards that refresh faster than a martini shaker.

### 6. Account Planner (a.k.a. â€œThe Voice of the Consumerâ€)
Not in Sterling Cooperâ€”born in 1970s London, imported later.
**Mission:** Translate human truths into briefs so sharp they could slice a necktie.
**Favorite toy:** 200-page ethnography on Gen-Z sadness, distilled into one sentence: â€œThey want brands to feel like group chats, not billboards.â€

### 7. Traffic Manager
**Then** | Joan Holloway, red-pen in one hand, cigarette in the other, routing mechanicals before deadline midnight.
**Now** | Operations or Project Manager, herding 12 time-zones via Asana.
**Super-hero name:** The Deadline Whisperer.

### 8. Brand Strategist
Didnâ€™t exist in Donâ€™s era; would have been mistaken for a communist.
**Purpose:** Find the North Star before creatives start sketching spaceships.
**Caffeine level:** Triple-shot cortado with a side of competitive-analysis PDFs.

### 9. Production Artist (Print) â†’ Digital Producer
**Then** | X-Acto blades and Letraset.
**Now** | Compresses 4K footage until it streams flawlessly on 3G in rural Sindh.
**Mantra:** â€œMake it smaller, make it faster, make it not break on iOS 17.â€

### 10. Office Manager â†’ Director of Operations
**Then** | Joan againâ€”scheduling, payroll, and the occasional emergency tracheotomy (lawn-mower accident, Season 3).
**Now** | Owns vendor relationships, SaaS budgets, and the sacred office cold-brew recipe.
**Hidden skill:** Can fire someone with empathy so pure it feels like a TED Talk hug.

### 11. Chief Creative Officer (CCO)
Evolution of Donâ€™s final-season partnership title.
**Job:** Bless ideas, charm shareholders, apologize for nothing.
**Clue youâ€™ve arrived:** Your LinkedIn bio is just one word: â€œStoryteller.â€

### 12. Chief Media Officer / Growth Officer
21st-century beast.
**Mandate:** Make every dollar accountable to a pixel, a cohort, a conversion.
**Nightmare:** iOS privacy update that turns the funnel into a tunnel.

### 13. Intern (Timeless)
**Then** | Fetching coffee, dry-cleaning, and existential dread.
**Now** | Fetching oat-milk lattes, TikTok trends, and stillâ€”existential dread.
**Rite of passage:** Being asked â€œWhat do you think?â€ in a meeting where 6-figure decisions hang in the air.

### A Modern-Day Glossary for Your Business Card Drawer
- **Creative Technologist** â€“ codes the idea you sketched on a napkin.
- **Social Listening Analyst** â€“ reads 50,000 tweets before breakfast so your brand doesnâ€™t trend for the wrong reason.
- **Influencer Manager** â€“ herds cats with 1 M followers and fragile egos.
- **Sustainability Consultant** â€“ makes sure your shoot in Patagonia doesnâ€™t actually destroy Patagonia.

### Parting Shot from the 37th Floor
Slide open that mahogany bar cart, pour three fingers of something peaty, and remember:

Titles change; human nature doesnâ€™t.

Clients still want miracles by Monday, creatives still want immortality by Friday, and somewhere a traffic manager is quietly keeping the universe from unravelingâ€”one deadline at a time.

Cheers to the carnival,
