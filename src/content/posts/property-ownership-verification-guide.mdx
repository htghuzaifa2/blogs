*(Updated 18 August 2025 | Covers Punjab, Sindh, KPK & Digital Solutions)*

### Step 1: Digital Verification via Provincial Portals

**Punjab (PLRA Portal)**

-   **Visit**: `punjab-zameen.gov.pk` → Property Registration [2][7].
-   **Search By**: Khewat number, CNIC, or owner name.
-   **Get Fard**: Download NADRA-verified Record of Rights (RoR) showing ownership history, liens, and disputes [4][9].
-   **E-Registration**: Digitally transfer deeds via integrated system.

**Sindh (LARIMS)**

-   **Visit**: `sindhzameen.gos.pk` → Search Registries.
-   **Enter**: Deh/Taluka details + owner CNIC.
-   **Verify**: View scanned original deed + mutation history [4][10].

**KPK/Balochistan**

-   **Limited Digitization**: Submit written application at Tehsil office for Fard-e-Malkiat [9].
-   **SMS Service**: Send property details to `8585` for basic info [10].

### Step 2: Physical Document Inspection

Critical Documents to Demand [6][10]:

| Document             | Purpose                                     | Red Flags                             |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Title Deed           | Legal ownership proof                       | Mismatched seller name                |
| Mother Deed          | Full ownership history (since 1st owner)    | Gaps in lineage                       |
| Encumbrance Cert     | Confirms no mortgages/liens                 | "Pending court cases" note            |
| NOC (Housing)        | Society approval by LDA/CDA/SBCA            | Fake logos; unverified contacts       |
| Tax Receipts         | Proof of paid property taxes                | Recent unpaid dues                    |

**Verify Authenticity**: Cross-check stamps/seals at Tehsil Revenue Office.

### 10 Property Fraud Red Flags (2025 Update) [3][8][11]

1.  **"Urgent Sale" Pressure**: "Buy today or offer gone!" tactics.
2.  **Unapproved Societies**: No LDA/CDA/SBCA master plan approval.
3.  **Cash-Only Demands**: Refusal of banking channels.
4.  **Below-Market Pricing**: "Bargains" hiding legal defects.
5.  **Vague Documentation**: Seller avoids sharing title deeds/NOCs.
6.  **Agent Without License**: No registered brokerage firm.
7.  **Boundary Discrepancies**: Actual plot size < paperwork claims.
8.  **Power of Attorney Loopholes**: Undated/generic PoA terms.
9.  **Token Money Traps**: Advance demanded before document checks.
10. **Fake "Completion Certs"**: For under-construction properties.

### Step 3: On-Ground Verification

**Physical Visit**:

-   Match plot location with khasra map at Tehsil office [1].
-   Check for encroachments or unauthorized constructions.

**Neighbor Validation**: Ask locals about:

-   Actual owner identity.
-   Ongoing disputes.

**Police Verification**: File request at local station for dispute history (₨200 fee).

### Legal Safeguards & Constitution

-   **Article 23/24**: Constitution guarantees property rights & compensation for public acquisitions [1].
-   **Transfer of Property Act (1882)**: Mandates registered sale deeds for validity [1][6].
-   **2025 Overseas Protections**: Submit sale deeds via Pakistani embassies; avoid PoA fraud [1].

### Pro Tips for Safe Transactions

-   **Hire a Property Lawyer**: Costs ₨15,000–₨30,000; verifies docs & drafts bomb-proof contracts [10].
-   **Use Escrow Accounts**: Pay via banks like HBL/UBL—funds released only after mutation.
-   **NADRA Verification**: SMS `PVS <13-digit-CNIC>` to `7000` for asset-linked report [9].
-   **Roshan Digital Accounts**: For overseas buyers—direct USD/PKR transfers tracked by SBP [3].

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem                       | Solution                                                          |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Khewat not found online"     | Visit Arzi Center (PLRA) with CNIC + witness [2]                  |
| "Seller avoids mutation"      | Freeze payment; file complaint at DC Office                       |
| "Fake NOC"                    | Cross-check with LDA/CDA helpline (e.g., LDA: 042-111-000-432) |
| "Encroachment found"          | Demand removal before payment; involve Tehsil court               |
