Board exams in Pakistan — just hearing the words is enough to make every student’s heartbeat skip a little faster. Whether you’re giving your Matric, Intermediate, or A-Level exams, that pressure is real. The endless notes, chai-fueled nights, parents’ expectations, and the fear of “yaar fail na ho jaayein” — it can be overwhelming.

But let’s pause for a moment. These exams are just a part of your life, not your whole story. So today, let’s talk about mental health, something we often ignore while chasing marks.

## 1. Understand That Stress Is Normal

First things first — stress during exams doesn’t mean you’re weak. It means you care. Even toppers feel anxious. The trick is not to eliminate stress, but to manage it.

> “You can’t calm the storm, so stop trying. What you can do is calm yourself — the storm will pass.”

Take deep breaths. Remind yourself that you’ve prepared, and you’ll do your best. That’s all that really matters.

## 2. Avoid the “All-Nighter” Trap

We’ve all done it — staying up till 3 a.m. with energy drinks, promising ourselves we’ll “sleep after exams.” But guess what? Lack of sleep ruins focus and memory retention.

Try this instead:

- Study in 2-hour focused sessions with 15-minute breaks.
- Sleep at least 6–7 hours before the paper.
- Avoid caffeine overdose — pani aur fruit zyada kaam aata hai.

## 3. Break Study Into Small Goals

Instead of saying “I’ll complete Physics today,” say “I’ll revise two chapters before lunch.”
Chhoti goals zyada realistic hoti hain, aur har goal complete karne par ek mini victory feel hoti hai.

Reward yourself — a snack, a walk, or a few minutes of scrolling (bas thoda).

## 4. Talk to Someone You Trust

Pressure kabhi kabhi andar daba reh jaata hai, aur phir explode karta hai. Don’t let that happen. Talk to a friend, sibling, or parent.

Even a short venting session like, “Yaar mujhe darr lag raha hai,” can help you breathe easier. You’ll realize you’re not alone — sab isi boat mai hain.

## 5. Practice Mini Mindfulness

When anxiety kicks in — heart beating fast, hands sweaty — close your eyes and do this:

- Take a slow deep breath in.
- Count till 4.
- Exhale slowly.
- Repeat 3 times.

It sounds simple, but it calms your nerves instantly.

## 6. Social Media Detox

During exam days, log out of the chaos.
Scrolling through memes or seeing others “study 10 hours a day” just adds pressure.
Put your phone aside during study hours — trust me, the world won’t end.

> “Focus on your chapter, not on others’ chapters in life.”

## 7. Eat and Move Right

Our desi exam diet: chips, chai, biscuits — aur phir headache. 😅
Your brain needs real fuel.
Eat fruits, eggs, nuts, and drink water. Go for a short walk or stretch your body. Physical health directly affects mental health.

## 8. Remember: Your Worth ≠ Your Marks

This one’s important, dost.
Marks don’t define your intelligence, kindness, or creativity.
You are more than a grade printed on paper.

Failure, if it ever happens, doesn’t mean “The End.” It just means “Not Yet.”

## Huzi’s Message to You

If you’re reading this while preparing for board exams — take a deep breath.
Look up from your book and tell yourself:

> “I’m doing my best, and that’s enough.”

One day, these exams will end. You’ll laugh about the stress, and you’ll move on to bigger, brighter dreams. But right now — take care of your mind. It’s the one thing that’ll stay with you forever.

### Final Note:
Pakistan ke students strong hain — we survive load-shedding, last-minute syllabus changes, aur kabhi kabhi parents’ lectures bhi 😅.
So yes, you can survive board exams too — just remember to protect your peace while chasing your dreams.
