Board exams in Pakistan ”” just hearing the words is enough to make every student”™s heartbeat skip a little faster. Whether you”™re giving your Matric, Intermediate, or A-Level exams, that pressure is real. The endless notes, chai-fueled nights, parents”™ expectations, and the fear of “yaar fail na ho jaayein” ”” it can be overwhelming.

But let”™s pause for a moment. These exams are just a part of your life, not your whole story. So today, let”™s talk about mental health, something we often ignore while chasing marks.

## 1. Understand That Stress Is Normal

First things first ”” stress during exams doesn”™t mean you”™re weak. It means you care. Even toppers feel anxious. The trick is not to eliminate stress, but to manage it.

> “You can”™t calm the storm, so stop trying. What you can do is calm yourself ”” the storm will pass.”

Take deep breaths. Remind yourself that you”™ve prepared, and you”™ll do your best. That”™s all that really matters.

## 2. Avoid the “All-Nighter” Trap

We”™ve all done it ”” staying up till 3 a.m. with energy drinks, promising ourselves we”™ll “sleep after exams.” But guess what? Lack of sleep ruins focus and memory retention.

Try this instead:

- Study in 2-hour focused sessions with 15-minute breaks.
- Sleep at least 6”“7 hours before the paper.
- Avoid caffeine overdose ”” pani aur fruit zyada kaam aata hai.

## 3. Break Study Into Small Goals

Instead of saying “I”™ll complete Physics today,” say “I”™ll revise two chapters before lunch.”
Chhoti goals zyada realistic hoti hain, aur har goal complete karne par ek mini victory feel hoti hai.

Reward yourself ”” a snack, a walk, or a few minutes of scrolling (bas thoda).

## 4. Talk to Someone You Trust

Pressure kabhi kabhi andar daba reh jaata hai, aur phir explode karta hai. Don”™t let that happen. Talk to a friend, sibling, or parent.

Even a short venting session like, “Yaar mujhe darr lag raha hai,” can help you breathe easier. You”™ll realize you”™re not alone ”” sab isi boat mai hain.

## 5. Practice Mini Mindfulness

When anxiety kicks in ”” heart beating fast, hands sweaty ”” close your eyes and do this:

- Take a slow deep breath in.
- Count till 4.
- Exhale slowly.
- Repeat 3 times.

It sounds simple, but it calms your nerves instantly.

## 6. Social Media Detox

During exam days, log out of the chaos.
Scrolling through memes or seeing others “study 10 hours a day” just adds pressure.
Put your phone aside during study hours ”” trust me, the world won”™t end.

> “Focus on your chapter, not on others”™ chapters in life.”

## 7. Eat and Move Right

Our desi exam diet: chips, chai, biscuits ”” aur phir headache. ðŸ˜…
Your brain needs real fuel.
Eat fruits, eggs, nuts, and drink water. Go for a short walk or stretch your body. Physical health directly affects mental health.

## 8. Remember: Your Worth â‰  Your Marks

This one”™s important, dost.
Marks don”™t define your intelligence, kindness, or creativity.
You are more than a grade printed on paper.

Failure, if it ever happens, doesn”™t mean “The End.” It just means “Not Yet.”

## Huzi”™s Message to You

If you”™re reading this while preparing for board exams ”” take a deep breath.
Look up from your book and tell yourself:

> “I”™m doing my best, and that”™s enough.”

One day, these exams will end. You”™ll laugh about the stress, and you”™ll move on to bigger, brighter dreams. But right now ”” take care of your mind. It”™s the one thing that”™ll stay with you forever.

### Final Note:
Pakistan ke students strong hain ”” we survive load-shedding, last-minute syllabus changes, aur kabhi kabhi parents”™ lectures bhi ðŸ˜….
So yes, you can survive board exams too ”” just remember to protect your peace while chasing your dreams.
