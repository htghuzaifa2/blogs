### VIII. Final Byte

Building an AI agent is less Frankenstein, more friendship””
you teach, test, laugh, repeat until the code finishes your sentences (and occasionally your snacks).

Hire the elf,
high-five the bot,
and remember:
if your agent ever says “I think, therefore I am,”
reply “Great, now think about my laundry.”

See you on the server-side,
