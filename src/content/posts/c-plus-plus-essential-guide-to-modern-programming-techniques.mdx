C++ has undergone a massive evolution. If you are still using `new` and `delete` manually, you are writing "C with Classes," not Modern C++.

Since C++11, the language has become safer, more expressive, and equally performant. Here are the core concepts you need to master.

## 1. Automatic Type Deduction (`auto`)
Stop writing verbose types. Let the compiler deduce it.

**Old Way:**
```cpp
std::vector<int>::iterator it = myVector.begin();
```

**Modern Way:**
```cpp
auto it = myVector.begin();
```
*Note*: The variable still has a strict type; the compiler just figures it out for you.

## 2. Smart Pointers (No More Memory Leaks)
Manual memory management is the #1 cause of bugs in C++. Modern C++ solves this with Smart Pointers (`<memory>`).

### `std::unique_ptr`
Ownership is exclusive. When the pointer goes out of scope, the memory is automatically freed.
```cpp
#include <memory>

void process() {
    std::unique_ptr<User> user = std::make_unique<User>("Huzi");
    user->sayHello();
} // 'user' is automatically deleted here. No memory leak.
```

### `std::shared_ptr`
Ownership is shared. The memory is deleted only when *all* pointers to it are gone.

## 3. Lambda Expressions
Anonymous functions that you can write inline.

```cpp
std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
// Filter even numbers
auto count = std::count_if(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [](int n) {
    return n % 2 == 0;
});
```
The `[](int n) { ... }` is the lambda. It makes code readable and concise.

## 4. Range-Based For Loops
Stop using index variables `i` when you don't need them.

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};

for (const auto& name : names) {
    std::cout << name << std::endl;
}
```

## 5. Move Semantics (`std::move`)
This is a performance game-changer. Instead of *copying* large objects, C++ can now *move* them (stealing their resources).
This avoids expensive deep copies, making C++ applications significantly faster.

## Conclusion
Modern C++ offers the high-level syntax of Python/JavaScript while keeping the low-level performance of C. Embrace these new features to write safer, faster, and cleaner code.
