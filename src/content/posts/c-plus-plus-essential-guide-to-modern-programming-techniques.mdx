<p>C++ is one of the most influential programming languages in software history. Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s, C++ was designed as an extension of the C programming language, bringing object-oriented programming (OOP), strong type checking, and higher-level abstractions — while keeping the raw power and control that made C so popular.</p>
<p>Today, C++ remains a cornerstone of the programming world. From operating systems and compilers to video games and high-frequency trading platforms, C++ powers some of the world’s fastest and most complex software systems.</p>
### Overview of C++
<p>C++ is a general-purpose, statically-typed, compiled language that combines high-level features with low-level control. This makes it unique — it’s flexible enough for application development but powerful enough for system-level programming.</p>
#### Why Learn C++?
<ul>
<li>Performance – C++ compiles to machine code, making it incredibly fast and efficient.</li>
<li>Control – Unlike languages like Python or Java, C++ gives full control over memory management, allowing optimization down to the byte.</li>
<li>Versatility – It’s used in games, embedded systems, AI, financial modeling, and operating systems.</li>
<li>Industry Demand – C++ developers are always in demand, especially in fields like gaming, finance, and systems engineering.</li>
</ul>
### Object-Oriented Programming in C++
<p>C++ introduced object-oriented programming to C, enabling encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>
