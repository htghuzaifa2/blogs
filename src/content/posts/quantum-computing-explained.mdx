Quantum computing sounds like science fiction, but it's a rapidly advancing field with the potential to solve problems that are currently intractable for even the most powerful supercomputers. In this article, we break down the core principles of quantum computing, such as qubits, superposition, and entanglement, in an accessible way. We'll explore the types of problems quantum computers are uniquely suited to solve, from developing new materials to revolutionizing medicine and finance. Discover why this technology represents a monumental leap in computational power.
