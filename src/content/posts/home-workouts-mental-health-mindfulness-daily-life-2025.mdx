Move like monsoon wind, breathe like the sea at dawn, notice life like it™s a sneak-preview”wellness isn™t a villa in Nathia Gali, **it™s a rickshaw tune-up you can do between notifications.

Start small, stay consistent, and remember:
if your breath isn™t smiling, neither is your future self.

Keep the body bright, the mind light, the breath right,
