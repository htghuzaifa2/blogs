“In 2025, visibility is no longer about ranking #1—it’s about being quoted.”

### 🔍 What AEO Actually Is

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the art and science of making your brand the single answer that AI systems—ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews (SGE), Perplexity, Bing Copilot—deliver when users ask questions.

It’s SEO 2.0: instead of fighting for a blue-link slot, you aim to be the cited source inside the AI response.

| Traditional SEO         | Answer Engine Optimization        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Goal:** Rank on page 1 | **Goal:** Be the quoted answer    |
| **Metric:** Organic clicks | **Metric:** Mentions, citations, referral traffic |
| **Tactic:** Keyword density | **Tactic:** Conversational, entity-rich answers |

### 📈 Why AEO Exploded in 2025

- 400 million weekly ChatGPT users
- 16% of Google desktop queries now show AI Overviews
- Zero-click searches exceed 65% on mobile—users never leave the AI

If you’re not optimised for AI answers, you’re literally invisible to the majority of searchers.

### 🛠️ How AI Engines Decide What to Quote

1.  **Pre-Training Data** (Common Crawl, Wikipedia, Reddit)
2.  **Real-Time Retrieval (RAG)** from authoritative pages
3.  **Structured Signals** (schema, backlinks, brand mentions)

Your mission? Be the best, most concise, most trusted source across all three layers.
