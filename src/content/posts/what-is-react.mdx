React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

## Core Concepts

### Components
React is all about building applications with components. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

### JSX (JavaScript XML)
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. It makes writing and adding HTML in React much simpler.

### State and Props
- **Props (short for properties):** are read-only attributes used to pass data from one component to another.
- **State:** is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

React is a powerful tool for building modern, fast, and scalable web applications.
