You did it. You’ve installed Arch Linux — the distro that makes you feel like a real hacker when the terminal finally says “Installation complete.”
But now what?

Arch, in its pure form, is like an empty house — solid foundation, but you’ve got to build the comfort yourself.
So today, let’s turn that fresh Arch install into a fast, beautiful, and reliable system you’ll love using every day.

Here are the Top 10 essential things to do after installing Arch Linux — from performance tweaks to UI polish.

🧰 1. Update Everything First

Before doing anything else, make sure your system is fully up-to-date.
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```
This syncs your package database and upgrades everything.
Think of it as giving your new system a health check before you start decorating.

🧩 2. Enable Multilib (for 32-bit Apps & Gaming)

Some apps — especially games and Steam — need 32-bit libraries.
To enable them:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf
```
Find this section:
```
#[multilib]
#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
Uncomment both lines (remove the `#`), save, and then run:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```
Boom — you can now install software that depends on 32-bit packages.

🧠 3. Install Essential Base Packages

Arch doesn’t include many basics, so let’s fix that.
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel git wget curl vim unzip zip htop neofetch
```
*   **base-devel**: required for compiling packages from AUR
*   **neofetch**: just to flex your setup 😎
*   **htop**: to monitor your CPU like a pro

💡 4. Install a Display Manager (Login Screen)

You need something that handles logins visually. For example:

For **KDE** or **GNOME**:
```bash
sudo pacman -S sddm
sudo systemctl enable sddm
```
For **XFCE** or **LXQt**:
```bash
sudo pacman -S lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter
sudo systemctl enable lightdm
```
Once enabled, you’ll have a friendly login screen waiting after reboot.

🖼️ 5. Choose and Install a Desktop Environment

This is where the fun begins. You can go minimal or fancy — totally your choice.

**KDE Plasma (Beautiful & Polished)**
```bash
sudo pacman -S plasma kde-applications
sudo systemctl enable sddm
```
**XFCE (Lightweight & Reliable)**
```bash
sudo pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter
sudo systemctl enable lightdm
```
**GNOME (Modern & Simple)**
```bash
sudo pacman -S gnome gdm
sudo systemctl enable gdm
```
Reboot afterward, and your Linux desktop world will come alive.

🧭 6. Enable Network and Bluetooth Services

Let’s make sure Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work properly.
```bash
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
```
For Bluetooth:
```bash
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```
Now you’re connected and wireless freedom is yours.

🚀 7. Install Yay (AUR Helper)

The Arch User Repository (AUR) is where magic happens — community packages, drivers, apps like Google Chrome, VS Code, and Spotify.

To install `yay`:
```bash
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER yay
cd yay
makepkg -si
```
Now you can install apps easily:
```bash
yay -S google-chrome visual-studio-code-bin
```

🧠 8. Optimize CPU and System Performance

Let’s make Arch fly.

**Enable Parallel Downloads**
Edit your Pacman config:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf
```
Uncomment:
`ParallelDownloads = 5`

**Enable CPU microcode updates:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S intel-ucode
```
or for AMD:
```bash
sudo pacman -S amd-ucode
```
Rebuild GRUB:
```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
**Enable ZRAM (faster swapping)**
```bash
sudo pacman -S zram-generator
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-zram-setup@zram0.service
```
Now your system swaps in RAM instead of slow disk space.

🎨 9. Customize Your UI (Make It Yours)

This is where Arch shines — it’s your Linux, your style.

**KDE users**:
Install some themes:
```bash
yay -S sweet-theme tela-icon-theme
```
Go to **System Settings → Appearance** and mix your favorite themes.

**XFCE users**:
Install Plank for a Mac-style dock:
```bash
sudo pacman -S plank
```
Add fonts and icons:
```bash
sudo pacman -S ttf-dejavu ttf-ubuntu-font-family ttf-font-awesome
```
Pro tip: less clutter = faster feel.

🔒 10. Security and Backup Essentials

Keep your system safe:
```bash
sudo pacman -S firewalld
sudo systemctl enable --now firewalld
```
And for easy rollback snapshots:
```bash
sudo pacman -S timeshift
sudo timeshift-launcher
```
If anything breaks (and it will, someday 😅), you can restore your system in minutes.

🌟 Bonus: Add Some Style to Your Terminal

Make your terminal inspiring:
```bash
yay -S oh-my-zsh-git powerlevel10k
```
Then set Zsh as default shell:
```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```
Now, every time you open your terminal, it’ll look like you actually know what you’re doing (even if you’re just typing `sudo pacman -Syu` again).

💬 Final Words by Huzi

Arch Linux isn’t just an OS — it’s a journey.
Every command teaches you something new. Every tweak makes your setup feel personal.
Once you start optimizing, you’ll realize Arch isn’t hard — it’s just honest. It gives you control, and in return, it asks for a little patience.

So customize it, break it, fix it, and make it yours.
