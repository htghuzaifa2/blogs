### 👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Marinate Chicken
Mix all marination ingredients in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate (⚠️ Essential for tender chicken).

#### 2. Prepare Rice
Boil water with whole spices and salt. Add soaked rice → cook until 70% done (al dente). Drain immediately → spread on tray to cool.

#### 3. Cook Chicken
Heat ghee/oil in heavy pot → add marinated chicken. Cook 10 mins on medium → add tomatoes → cook 5 mins until oil separates.

⚠️ *Do not overcook – chicken will steam with rice later.*

#### 4. Layering (The Biryani Art)
1.  **Base**: Spread chicken masala evenly
2.  **Herb Layer**: ½ mint + ½ coriander + green chilies + reserved fried onions
3.  **Rice Layer**: Cover with 50% rice
4.  **Saffron Drizzle**: ½ saffron milk + ½ kewra water
5.  **Repeat**: Remaining herbs → remaining rice → saffron/kewra
6.  **Seal**: Cover with foil → tight lid (*dum* steam lock)

#### 5. Dum Cooking (Steam Finish)
Cook on LOW heat 25 mins. Turn off heat → rest 15 mins (no peeking!).
**Pro Tip:** Place tawa/griddle under pot to prevent burning.

#### 6. Serving Ritual
Gently mix layers → garnish with fried onions & fresh mint. Serve with:
-   **Raita** (yogurt with cucumber & mint)
-   **Salad** (onion rings + lemon wedges)

### 📜 Biryani Pro Secrets

-   **Rice Perfection**: Soak rice 30 mins → boil with 1 tbsp vinegar for whiter grains.
-   **Caramelized Onions**: Fry sliced onions on low heat 20 mins until golden-brown.
-   **Saffron Hack**: Crush threads with sugar before adding to milk.
-   **Leftover Magic**: Reheat in microwave with sprinkled water → cover loosely.

> "The test of true biryani? Every grain stands apart yet wears the perfume of a thousand spices."

Serve with love – and extra raita for fire control!

#### Pairing Suggestions:
-   **Drink**: Masala chai or mint lassi
-   **Dessert**: Kheer (rice pudding)

#### Cooking Notes:
-   **For Hyderabadi style**: Add ½ cup chopped cilantro stems in masala
-   **For Sindhi style**: Layer boiled potatoes with chicken
-   **Vegetarian Swap**: Replace chicken with chickpeas + paneer
