## Introduction: From Words to Intelligence
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text and code. They learn the patterns, grammar, and nuances of human language to generate new content, answer questions, and more.</p>

### Step 1: Tokenization
<p>The first step is to break down text into smaller pieces called <strong>tokens</strong>. A token can be a word or part of a word. Each token is then assigned a unique number.</p>
      
### Step 2: Embeddings
<p>Tokens are converted into <strong>embeddings</strong>, which are vectors (lists of numbers) that represent the token's meaning in a multi-dimensional space. Words with similar meanings have similar vectors.</p>

### Step 3: The Transformer Architecture
<p>The core of modern LLMs is the <strong>Transformer</strong> architecture. Its key innovation is the <strong>self-attention mechanism</strong>, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence to understand context.</p>
