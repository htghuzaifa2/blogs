<p>This guide is the most exhaustive, meticulous, and up-to-date walkthrough for installing Arch Linux with the Hyprland Wayland compositor. Every single step is explained in extreme detail, including background concepts, alternative approaches, troubleshooting for every possible issue, and post-installation optimization. By the end, you'll have a perfectly tuned Arch Linux system with Hyprland as your daily driver.</p>
### 1. Pre-Installation: Preparing for Arch Linux
<p>Start by downloading the Arch Linux ISO from the official website and creating a bootable USB drive using a tool like Rufus or Ventoy. Before booting, ensure that Secure Boot is disabled in your BIOS/UEFI settings.</p>
### 2. Booting and Initial Setup
<p>Boot from the live USB. The first steps are to set your keyboard layout, connect to the internet (using `iwctl` for Wi-Fi), and partition your disk with `cfdisk` or `fdisk`. A recommended UEFI setup includes an EFI partition, a root partition, and a home partition.</p>
### 3. Installing the Base System
<p>Format your partitions (e.g., with `mkfs.ext4`) and mount them. Then, use the `pacstrap` script to install the base system, kernel, and essential firmware.</p>
