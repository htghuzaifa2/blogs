Arch Linux. Hyprland. On a phone.
Why? Because we can.

Running a tiling window manager (Hyprland) designed for keyboards on a 6-inch touch screen is not "practical." It is, however, an incredible learning experience and a testament to the flexibility of Linux.

## The Feasibility Check
**Hyprland** is a Wayland compositor. It relies heavily on keyboard shortcuts (Super+Q to close, Super+Enter to open terminal).
- **On a Phone**: Unless you have a Bluetooth keyboard connected, this is going to be painful.
- **Better Alternatives**: **Phosh** (Phone Shell) or **Plasma Mobile** are designed for touch.

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Termux + Proot-Distro (The "Easy" Way)
You can run Arch inside Android without root.
1.  Install **Termux**.
2.  Run `pkg install proot-distro`.
3.  Run `proot-distro install archlinux`.
4.  Login: `proot-distro login archlinux`.
*Note*: Running a Wayland compositor here requires setting up XWayland or Termux-X11, which is advanced.

### Method 2: PostmarketOS (The Native Way)
If you have a device like the **PinePhone** or a supported Android device (check the PostmarketOS wiki), you can replace Android entirely.
- This gives you a true Linux kernel.
- You can install `hyprland` via Pacman just like on a desktop.

## Configuration for Mobile
If you do get Hyprland running, you'll need to adapt the config `hyprland.conf`:
- **Scale**: Set monitor scaling to 2.0 or higher so text is readable.
- **Gestures**: Configure touch gestures (workspace swipe) to replace keyboard shortcuts.
- **On-Screen Keyboard**: Install `wvkbd` or similar Wayland virtual keyboards.

## Conclusion
This is strictly a "for fun" project. Do not replace your daily driver Android OS with this setup unless you love debugging config files at 2 AM. But if you do... welcome to the club. BTW, I use Arch regarding of the device.
