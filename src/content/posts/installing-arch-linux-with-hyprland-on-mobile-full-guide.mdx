### Is It Feasible?
<p>Running Hyprland on a mobile device is an experimental endeavor. Hyprland is a tiling Wayland compositor optimized for keyboard-driven workflows, not touch interfaces. For a more practical mobile Linux experience, consider alternatives like Phosh or Plasma Mobile, which are designed for small touchscreens.</p>
<p>This guide is for enthusiasts who wish to proceed, likely on a tablet or a phone with an external keyboard.</p>
### Installation Methods
#### A. No-Root via Termux + PROOT
<p>This is the safest method. It runs Arch Linux inside a container on your existing Android system.</p>
#### B. Rooted Device with Full Arch Linux ARM
<p>This method provides native performance but requires a supported device (like a PinePhone), an unlocked bootloader, and custom recovery.</p>
### Conclusion
<p>While installing Hyprland on a mobile device is a fascinating technical challenge, it is not recommended for daily use on a typical smartphone. It remains a project for tinkerers and Linux enthusiasts who enjoy pushing the boundaries of what their hardware can do.</p>
