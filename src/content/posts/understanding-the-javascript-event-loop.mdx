## Introduction: The Concurrency Puzzle
<p>JavaScript has a single thread, yet it can handle multiple operations concurrently without blocking the user interface. This is made possible by the <strong>Event Loop</strong>.</p>
      
### The Core Components
<ul>
  <li><strong>Call Stack:</strong> Where functions that are currently being executed are tracked.</li>
  <li><strong>Web APIs:</strong> Provided by the browser to handle async tasks like `setTimeout` and `fetch`.</li>
  <li><strong>Callback Queue (or Task Queue):</strong> A waiting area for callback functions that are ready to be executed.</li>
  <li><strong>Event Loop:</strong> Its job is to move tasks from the Callback Queue to the Call Stack when the stack is empty.</li>
</ul>

  One single thread, a loop so fast,<br/>
  A non-blocking future, built to last.
