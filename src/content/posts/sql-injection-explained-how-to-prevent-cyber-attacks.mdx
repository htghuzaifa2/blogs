title: "SQL Injection Explained: How to Prevent the Web's Most Devastating Cyber Attack"
excerpt: "SQL Injection (SQLi) has been a top web security vulnerability for over two decades, yet it continues to be the cause of catastrophic data breaches. This guide provides a deep, practical dive into what SQLi is, how it works, and most importantly, how to build ironclad defenses against it."

Imagine a burglar who doesn't pick the lock but simply asks the house to "open all doors" and the house obeys. That is **SQL Injection (SQLi)**.

It occurs when an application takes user input and blindly inserts it into a database query.

## How It Works (The "Door Open" Trick)
Suppose you have a login query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$user_input' AND password = '$password_input';
```

If the user enters `admin` as the username, it works fine. But what if they enter:
`admin' --`

The query becomes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = '...';
```
In SQL, `--` means "comment". The database ignores everything after it (the password check!). The attacker logs in as admin without a password.

## The Consequences
- **Data Theft**: Dumping the entire customer database.
- **Data Deletion**: `DROP TABLE users`.
- **Authentication Bypass**: Logging in as anyone.

## The Solution: Parameterized Queries
**Never** concatenate strings to build SQL queries. Use "Prepared Statements."

**Vulnerable Code (Node.js):**
```javascript
db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId);
```

**Secure Code:**
```javascript
db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [userId]);
```
In the secure version, the database treats the input strictly as data, not as executable code. Even if the input contains SQL commands, they are harmless text.

## Other Defenses
1.  **Use an ORM**: Tools like Sequelize, TypeORM, or Prisma use parameterized queries by default.
2.  **Least Privilege**: The database user for your web app should not have permission to delete tables (`DROP`) unless absolutely necessary.

## Conclusion
SQLi is 100% preventable. If your site is vulnerable to it in 2025, it is a sign of negligence. Sanitize inputs, use an ORM, and sleep safe.
