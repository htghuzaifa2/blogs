<p>Did you know? 43% of all hacked websites run WordPress. But here's the truth: WordPress itself isn't insecure - it's how you configure it. This guide reveals an enterprise-grade security protocol that costs $0 to implement, using a layered defense strategy.</p>
### Phase 1: Foundational Hardening
<p>Start with server-level and WordPress core hardening. Use `.htaccess` to protect critical files like `wp-config.php` and disable PHP execution in the uploads directory. In `wp-config.php`, disallow file editing and force SSL for the admin panel.</p>
      
### Phase 2: Advanced Attack Surface Reduction
<p>Fortify your login page by renaming `wp-login.php` and enforcing two-factor authentication. Set up file integrity monitoring to get alerts when core files change. Use a dedicated, limited-privilege database user instead of the root user.</p>

### Phase 3: Active Defense Systems
<p>Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) like the one from Cloudflare to block common attacks. Set up honeypot traps, such as decoy admin accounts, to identify and block malicious actors. Regularly scan for malware using command-line tools like ClamAV or WPScan.</p>
