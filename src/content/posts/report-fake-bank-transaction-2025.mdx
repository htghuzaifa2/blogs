“Every hour counts when your money is on the line.”

Here are the step-by-step paths for reporting a fake bank transaction to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Banking Mohtasib, and your own bank—all updated for 2025.

### ⚠️ Act Fast – The 24-Hour Rule

If you notice an unauthorised debit, fake credit, or suspicious transaction, **report it the SAME DAY** to freeze the trail and maximize your chances of recovery.

### 🏦 Step 1 – Contact Your Bank (Always First)

Your bank is your first point of contact. They must respond within 10 working days as per SBP regulations.

| Bank Channel | What to Do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **24/7 Helpline** | Call the toll-free number (e.g., UBL 111-825-888, HBL 111-111-425) and say **“fraudulent transaction”** to get connected to the fraud department immediately. |
| **Branch Visit** | Fill out a **Dispute Form** and attach an FIR copy (if applicable) within 5 working days. |
| **Bank App / Internet Banking** | Use the “Report Fraud” or “Dispute Transaction” button. Upload screenshots and the FIR. |

### 🏛️ Step 2 – State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) – Consumer Protection

If your bank does NOT resolve the issue in 10 days, escalate to SBP.

| Channel | Link / Contact | Documents Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Online Form** | SBP Sunwai Portal: `sunwai.sbp.org.pk` | CNIC, bank's reply, transaction slip |
| **Email** | `cpd.helpdesk@sbp.org.pk` | Same docs + a clear timeline of events |
| **Helpline** | `021-111-727-273` (Mon–Fri 9 AM–5 PM) | For guidance and follow-up |

*SBP aims to resolve fraud cases within 30 days.*

### ⚖️ Step 3 – Banking Mohtasib (If Bank + SBP Fail)

Use this channel if 45 days have passed since your *first complaint to the bank*.

| Channel | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Online Form** | `bankingmohtasib.gov.pk` → Complaint Form |
| **Email** | `info@bankingmohtasib.gov.pk` |
| **Postal Address** | Banking Mohtasib Pakistan, Shaheen Complex, 5th Floor, M. R. Kiyani Road, Karachi |

**Required Docs**: Proof of 45-day wait, bank’s reply, and your CNIC. The decision usually comes within 2 months.

### 🚔 Step 4 – File an FIR (For Large Fraud)

File an FIR at the police station nearest to your bank branch. This is crucial for legal proceedings.

**Template FIR:**
````
Subject: Cyber Fraud FIR

Details: On [date], an amount of ₨ [amount] was debited without my consent from my account [number] via [ATM/IBFT/etc.].

Evidence: Attached bank statement + screenshots.
````
*Attach this FIR copy to all your complaints to the bank, SBP, and Banking Mohtasib.*

### 📋 Checklist – Required Documents

| **Bank Statement** | All channels |
