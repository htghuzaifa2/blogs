### What You Gain with Xiaomi 15 Pro (The Flagship)

*   **Premium Display & Visuals:** A higher resolution, brighter, and more color-accurate screen. If you consume HDR content or use your phone outdoors, you™ll feel the difference.
*   **Better Cameras (Especially Zoom & Low-Light):** Superior lenses, sensors, and image processing deliver more consistent, detailed photos in challenging conditions.
*   **Longer Software Support:** Flagships typically receive more Android and security updates, keeping the phone smoother and more secure for 2-3+ years.
*   **Premium Feel & Extras:** You get features like wireless charging, IP water/dust resistance, higher-quality build materials, and better stereo speakers.

### What You Sacrifice with Xiaomi 15 Pro (And Gain with Infinix)

*   **Price:** The Xiaomi 15 Pro is significantly more expensive. In Pakistan, it starts around PKR ~199,999, whereas the Infinix Zero Ultra 5G is priced around PKR ~99,999. You're paying nearly double.
*   **Wired Charging Speed:** The Infinix boasts an incredible 180W wired charging speed, which can fill the battery in minutes. If you need quick top-ups, this is a major advantage.
*   **Value for Money:** For many daily tasks”social media, streaming, daylight photography”the Infinix delivers a fantastic experience at half the cost. You pay a premium for flagship features you might not fully use.

### What You Lose with Infinix Zero Ultra (vs. Xiaomi 15 Pro)

*   **Lower Display Fidelity:** While still a 120Hz AMOLED, the resolution and peak brightness are lower.
*   **Mid-Range Processor:** The Dimensity 920 is capable for daily use, but it can't match the raw power and future-proofing of a flagship Snapdragon chip for heavy gaming or multitasking.
*   **Durability & Extras Missing:** You™ll likely miss out on wireless charging, official water/dust resistance, and the premium feel of higher-end materials.
*   **Camera Trade-Offs:** The 200MP main camera is impressive on paper, but the Xiaomi 15 Pro™s superior sensors and lenses will outperform it in low light, zoom, and video quality.

### Price in Pakistan & What That Means

*   **Xiaomi 15 Pro:** Starts around **PKR 199,999** for the 12GB/256GB variant.
*   **Infinix Zero Ultra 5G:** Hovers around **PKR 99,999** for the 8GB/256GB model.

This is a classic "value vs. premium" choice. For the price of one Xiaomi 15 Pro, you could almost buy two Infinix Zero Ultras.
