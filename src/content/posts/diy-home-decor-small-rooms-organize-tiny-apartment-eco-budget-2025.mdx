Below: poetic projects, landlord-friendly hacks, and eco-upgrades tested in hostel dorms, bachelor pads, and mum-monitored lounges.

No sledgehammers, no sorrow—just creativity on a chai-budget.

3.  **Fairy-Light Headboard — Dream in LEDs**
    *   **Cost**: ₨600 ( 20 ft USB warm-white )

**Micro-Kitchen Hack**

5.  **Charcoal Water Filter Stick — De-Chlorinate Tap**
    *   **Cost**: ₨400 — lasts 6 months

### IV. 48-Hour Makeover Calendar (weekend warriors, assemble!)

### V. Final Nail

Small spaces aren’t problems—**they’re poems waiting for punctuation.**

Peel, stick, fold, plant—every inch earns rent, every rupee gets a receipt, and the planet gets a thank-you card.

If the drill bends, call it abstract art—**but call it yours.**

See you on the ladder-side,
