### V. Final Nail

Small spaces arenâ€™t problemsâ€”**theyâ€™re poems waiting for punctuation.**

Peel, stick, fold, plantâ€”every inch earns rent, every rupee gets a receipt, and the planet gets a thank-you card.

If the drill bends, call it abstract artâ€”**but call it yours.**

See you on the ladder-side,
