Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.

## What is it used for?

Kali comes pre-installed with over 600 penetration-testing programs, including:

- **Nmap** (a port scanner)
- **Wireshark** (a packet analyzer)
- **Metasploit Framework** (a tool for developing and executing exploit code)
- **Aircrack-ng** (a software suite for password cracking)
- **Burp Suite** (a graphical tool for web application security)

## Who should use it?

While Kali Linux can be used by anyone, it is specifically geared towards security professionals and enthusiasts. If you are a beginner to Linux, it's often recommended to start with a more user-friendly distribution like Ubuntu or Mint.

## Installation

You can install Kali Linux in several ways:

1.  **Bare Metal:** Installing it directly on your computer's hardware.
2.  **Virtual Machine:** Running Kali inside a VM (like VirtualBox or VMware) on your existing operating system. This is the safest and most recommended method for beginners.
3.  **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):** Running Kali directly within Windows 10/11.

Remember to always use the tools included in Kali Linux responsibly and ethically.
