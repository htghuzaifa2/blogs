TextField(
  textDirection: TextDirection.rtl,
  controller: _urduController,
  inputFormatters: [UrduInputFormatter()],
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    hintText: 'Ø§Ù¾Ù†Ø§ Ù¾ÛŒØºØ§Ù… Ù„Ú©Ú¾ÛŒÚº',
    hintTextDirection: TextDirection.rtl,
  ),

### VI. Community & Events (mark your calendar)

- Lahore Google Developer Groups (GDG) â€“ monthly Firebase study jams; certificates look good on LinkedIn.
- Islamabad Start-up Grind â€“ virtual if roads blocked; last session had Zoom attendance from Swatâ€”mountain-start-ups rising!

### VII. Final Byte
Pakistanâ€™s app economy is no longer the â€œnext big thingâ€â€”itâ€™s the now big thing.
Build for local pain, global standards, and patchy networks; youâ€™ll ship faster than a Rajanpur truck and scale taller than K2.
