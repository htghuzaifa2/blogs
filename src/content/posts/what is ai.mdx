Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad area of computer science that makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing.

Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.

### Types of AI

AI can be categorized into two main types:

1.  **Narrow AI (or Weak AI):** This type of AI is designed and trained for a particular task. Virtual assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are a form of Narrow AI.
2.  **General AI (or Strong AI):** This is the type of AI we see in movies, like the robots from *Westworld* or the character Data from *Star Trek: The Next Generation*. It is an AI with a human-like consciousness that can understand, learn, and apply its intelligence to solve any problem.

### AI in Our Daily Lives

From voice assistants and recommendation engines to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnoses, AI is transforming industries and making our lives more efficient. As the technology continues to evolve, its potential to reshape our world is limitless.
