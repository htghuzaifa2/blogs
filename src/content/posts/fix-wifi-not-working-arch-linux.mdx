One of the most common issues after installing Arch Linux "” especially on laptops "” is that Wi-Fi doesn"™t work after your first boot. Don"™t worry "” this is easy to fix once you understand what"™s missing.

This guide covers everything you need to get your Wi-Fi working again, including enabling NetworkManager, installing wireless drivers and firmware, and diagnosing adapter issues.

## Step 1: Check if NetworkManager Is Installed

Arch doesn"™t install everything automatically. First, ensure NetworkManager is present.

Run:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu networkmanager
```
If it says "up to date," good. Otherwise, it will install it.

Now enable it to start at boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
```
Check its status:
```bash
systemctl status NetworkManager
```
If you see **active (running)** "” your service is fine.

## Step 2: Detect Your Wireless Adapter

Let"™s confirm your system can detect your Wi-Fi card.

Run:
```bash
lspci | grep -i network
```
Or, for USB adapters:
```bash
lsusb
```
You"™ll see something like: `Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 8265 / 8275`. If you see no output, your system isn"™t detecting your adapter â†’ skip to Step 5.

## Step 3: Check Wi-Fi Interface Availability

Now, verify your wireless interface:
```bash
ip link
```
You should see something like `wlan0` or `wlp2s0`. If you see it but Wi-Fi still doesn"™t show up, your driver is loaded, but NetworkManager may need a restart:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```
If the interface doesn"™t appear, go to Step 5.

## Step 4: Connect to Wi-Fi via Terminal (Temporary Fix)

If you have no GUI yet, use `nmcli` (command-line tool for NetworkManager):

List available Wi-Fi networks:
```bash
nmcli dev wifi list
```
Connect:
```bash
nmcli dev wifi connect "Your_WiFi_Name" password "YourPassword"
```
To test connectivity:
```bash
ping -c 4 archlinux.org
```
If you get responses "” you"™re online âœ…

## Step 5: Install Missing Wi-Fi Drivers

Most laptops need proprietary drivers or firmware. Run this to install the most common packages:
```bash
sudo pacman -S linux-firmware
```
Then reboot:
```bash
sudo reboot
```
Still not working? Identify your card and install the proper driver.

### Intel Wi-Fi
```bash
sudo pacman -S iwd
sudo systemctl enable iwd
sudo systemctl start iwd
```

### Broadcom (common on Dell/HP)
```bash
sudo pacman -S broadcom-wl-dkms
sudo modprobe wl
```

### Realtek (USB adapters, budget laptops)
```bash
sudo pacman -S rtl88xxau-dkms
```
(You may need the `base-devel` package to build DKMS drivers)

### AUR Alternative
If you have no Ethernet, connect your phone via USB tethering, then:
```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
yay -S rtl8821ce-dkms
```

## Step 6: Verify Kernel Module Is Loaded

After installing drivers, check:
```bash
sudo lshw -C network
```
or
```bash
sudo dmesg | grep wlan
```
If you see your adapter initialized, it means the driver is loaded successfully.

## Step 7: Enable Wi-Fi Auto-Connection

To make sure Wi-Fi reconnects automatically on boot:
```bash
nmcli connection modify "Your_WiFi_Name" connection.autoconnect yes
```

## Step 8: Install a GUI Network Tool (Optional)

If you"™re using a desktop environment, make sure you have the network applet installed:

-   **KDE Plasma:** `sudo pacman -S plasma-nm`
-   **XFCE:** `sudo pacman -S network-manager-applet`
-   **GNOME:** Already included with `gnome-control-center`.

Reboot and check your Wi-Fi icon "” it should show available networks.

## Step 9: Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem                  | Solution                                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Wi-Fi disappears after suspend | `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager`             |
| "No Wi-Fi Adapter Found"   | Reinstall firmware or kernel modules.               |
| No wireless extensions found | Run `rfkill unblock wifi`                           |
| Can"™t detect 5GHz networks   | Ensure regdom is set: `sudo iw reg set PK`          |

## Step 10: Advanced Debugging

If still broken, run `dmesg | grep wifi` and check for errors like: `firmware: failed to load iwlwifi-7265D-29.ucode`. Then manually install the missing firmware via `sudo pacman -S linux-firmware` or download it from the [Linux firmware git repository](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git).

## Quick Summary

-   Ensure NetworkManager is installed and enabled.
-   Install `linux-firmware` and the right Wi-Fi driver for your hardware.
-   Use `nmcli` or a GUI to connect.
-   Reboot "” your Wi-Fi should now work permanently.

### Conclusion

Fixing Wi-Fi on Arch Linux may seem intimidating, but it becomes simple once you understand the system services. Arch gives you full control, and that includes managing drivers. Once set up, your Wi-Fi will work smoothly across reboots.
