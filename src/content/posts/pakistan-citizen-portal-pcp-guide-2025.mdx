*"In 2025, your complaint moves faster than a WhatsApp message—if you navigate PCP’s digital corridors right."*

### Step 1: Download & Install

- **Android**: [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.govpk.citizensportal) → Search "Pakistan Citizen Portal"
- **iOS**: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/pk/app/pakistan-citizens-portal/id1439885831) → Download Pakistan Citizen Portal
- **Compatibility**: Requires iOS 11+ or Android 7.0+
- **Size**: 77.5 MB (iOS) / 55 MB (Android)

**Critical Fixes (2025 Updates):**
- **Email Verification Bug**: If the app crashes during verification, go to Menu → "Verify Email" instead of the main pop-up.
- **International Numbers**: Pad shorter foreign numbers with zeros during registration (e.g., `123456` → `1234560000`).

### Step 2: Register Your Account

1.  Open App → Tap "Register"
2.  **Enter Details**:
    - CNIC (no dashes)
    - Mobile number (Pakistani or padded international)
    - Email (active for OTP)
3.  **Verify**:
    - SMS OTP sent to mobile
    - Email link (check spam)
4.  **Set Password**: 8+ characters with uppercase + number

**Pro Tip**: Overseas Pakistanis must register with a Pakistani CNIC + foreign number (use a family’s Pakistan number if unavailable).

### Step 3: Submit a Complaint

1.  Tap **"+"** → Select **"Complaint"**
2.  **Fill Form**:
    - **Category**: Choose from 40+ options (e.g., "Police Misconduct", "Electricity Overbilling")
    - **Description**: Be specific: *"LESCO bill #XX-XXXXXX charged ₨12,000 for 200 units—meter photo attached."*
    - **Attachments**: Upload bills, photos, FIRs (max 5 files, 2MB each)
    - **Location**: Enable GPS or pin manually
3.  **Submit** → Note 10-digit token number (e.g., PCP-2025-XXXXXX)

**Avoid Rejection**:
- No anonymous complaints.
- Politically sensitive issues require lawyer support.

### Step 4: Track Complaint Status

**Method 1: App Dashboard** → "My Complaints" → View real-time stages:

| Status              | Meaning                                       | Next Step                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Received            | Complaint logged                              | Wait 48 hrs                      |
| Forwarded           | Sent to relevant department (e.g., WAPDA)   | Monitor daily                    |
| Under Investigation | Department verifying claims                   | Respond if evidence is needed    |
| Resolved            | Closed by department                          | Rate satisfaction                |

**Method 3**: Web portal → `8171.bisp.gov.pk` → Enter token/CNIC

**User Alert**: Departments can mark complaints "resolved" without your consent. Demand reopening rights via app feedback.
