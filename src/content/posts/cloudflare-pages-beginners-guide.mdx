## Why Cloudflare Pages is Revolutionizing Web Development
<p>Cloudflare Pages is a JAMstack platform that combines Git-based workflows, serverless functions, and enterprise-grade infrastructure. It offers automatic SSL, global CDN distribution, and unlimited free collaborators, eliminating traditional deployment headaches.</p>
      
### Step 1: Setup and Scaffolding
<p>Start by setting up a Git repository (GitHub/GitLab) and your local development environment with Node.js and a code editor. Scaffold a new project using a modern framework like Vite for React, or Next.js for a full-stack experience.</p>
      
### Step 2: Deployment Masterclass
<p>Connect your Git provider to the Cloudflare Dashboard. Cloudflare will auto-detect your framework and configure the build settings. Pushing code to your main branch will trigger a build and deploy the site to Cloudflare's global edge network.</p>
      
### Step 3: Custom Domains and Advanced Features
<p>Easily connect a custom domain by adding a CNAME record in your DNS provider. Enhance your site with Pages Functions (serverless APIs), Turnstile for CAPTCHA-free bot protection, and image resizing for performance optimization.</p>
