## Introduction: The Science of Secret Writing
<p>Cryptography is the practice of techniques for secure communication. It provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation for our digital information.</p>

### Symmetric Key Cryptography: The Single Key
<p>In symmetric cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It's fast and efficient, making it ideal for encrypting large amounts of data. The most common algorithm is <strong>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</strong>.</p>

### Asymmetric Key Cryptography: The Public/Private Key Pair
<p>Asymmetric cryptography uses two related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This solves the key distribution problem. The most widely used algorithm is <strong>RSA</strong>.</p>
