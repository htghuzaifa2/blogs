In Pakistan, as solar panels crowd rooftops and solar farms mirror the horizon, a quieter revolution is happening behind locked steel doors: data centres powered by renewable energy. These centres promise not just computational power, but cleaner, greener infrastructure that matches global sustainability goals. Below are some of the top green/renewable-oriented data centres and projects, how solar is reshaping tech infrastructure, what’s working, and what more we need.

### 1. Data Vault Pakistan (Karachi)

#### What is it?

Pakistan’s first AI-focused data centre built with full solar-powered operations.

Designed for GPU-as-a-Service, cloud/AI workloads, secure storage, local sovereignty of data.

#### Green / Solar Features

- Operates entirely on solar power.
- Energy efficient cooling systems.
- Quantum encryption + zero-trust architecture paired with clean energy usage.

#### Pros & Challenges

**Pros:** First mover; strong sustainability credentials; potentially significantly reduced carbon footprint; supports local AI research & startups; reduces dependence on foreign cloud providers.

**Challenges:** Solar power depends on sunlight; backup or grid reliability during cloudy hours / at night; upfront cost of solar infrastructure; ensuring cooling & power redundancy is maintained; scaling as demand grows. Not all details of capacity, efficiency (PUE, etc.) are publicly disclosed yet.

### 2. Al Nahal Data Center (Sindh Education City, Special Technology Zone)

#### What is it?

Planned sovereign, ESG-compliant Tier III+ modular data centre.

Located within a technology zone, aimed at AI-ready workloads, sovereign cloud, edge computing.

#### Green / Renewable Features

- Will use a hybrid renewable microgrid (solar + wind) with battery backup.
- PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) planned at ≤ 1.5 (which is a decent target for efficiency).

#### Pros & What’s Unclear

**Pros:** Mix of renewable sources increases reliability; hybrid setup helps during non-sun hours; situating in STZ gives regulatory benefits and potential for infrastructure support.

**What needs confirming:** Current stage (under construction? operational parts?), how many MW capacity, detailed performance metrics; how much solar vs wind; battery storage size; cost economics; environmental impact studies.

### 3. Other Data Centres with Green Ambitions

This is where information becomes scarce — many data centres are talking about efficiency, renewable energy, but not all have full solar-power operations. Based on reports:

- Many legacy data centres in Pakistan still use grid/ diesel generators / non-renewable sources, and have “outdated cooling systems.”
- Some newer / upcoming data centre designs aim to incorporate renewable energy (solar, wind) or to enter into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for green energy.
- The government has allocated 2,000 MW of electricity to AI/data centres / Bitcoin mining, some of which is expected to come from surplus and renewable sources. This policy environment encourages green data centre development.

### 4. Prefab / Edge / University Data Centres

An example: The Astrolabes Data Center at NED University of Engineering & Technology, Karachi. It is a prefabricated / containerized (“prefab”) data centre built by Huawei + DWP Technologies. While the announcement mentions improved infrastructure and pushing knowledge economy forward, it doesn’t yet clearly state full renewable power usage or solar integration.

University of Turbat also deployed a data centre and in its first phase included a small solar project of ~1 MW. That shows part-green infrastructure in action.

### 5. What’s Motivating More Green Data Centres

Beyond specific centres, these forces are helping drive change in Pakistan’s tech infrastructure:

- **Solar Boom:** Solar energy’s share in Pakistan’s electricity mix has surged: solar farms supplying at least ~25% of utility electricity in early-2025.
- **Policy Initiatives:** The 2,000 MW allocation for AI / bitcoin / data centres from surplus electricity. This gives incentive to use renewables / cheaper green energy to reduce cost and carbon.
- **Economic & Environmental Pressures:** High electricity costs, load shedding, carbon emissions, climate obligations—businesses & centres realize that green energy can lower operational costs long-term.

### Why Solar (and Renewables) Are Critical for the Future of Data Centres in Pakistan

| Benefit | Why It Matters in Pakistan |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost Savings Over Time** | Once solar panels are installed, marginal cost of electricity drops; diesel backup cost is high; frequent power outages raise cost if relying on generators. |
| **Energy Independence & Reliability** | Solar + battery helps mitigate grid instability, load shedding, rising energy tariffs. Critical for 24/7 operations. |
| **Environmental Sustainability** | Lowering carbon emissions, aligning with global/UN / SDG targets; improving reputation & regulatory compliance. |
| **Attracting Investment** | Foreign companies / global tech prefer green-certified, low carbon / compliant infrastructure. Green credentials are a differentiator. |
| **Supporting Local AI & Cloud Ecosystem** | With local green data centres, startups and universities can run workloads without high energy or import costs; data sovereignty is strengthened. |

### What’s Still Needed & Major Challenges

Even with centres like Data Vault and Al Nahal promising green operations, Pakistan faces hurdles:

- **Scale & Capacity:** Few centres are yet at large scale with verified metrics (how much of their power truly comes from solar/wind then stored). Solar alone may not give continuous power; battery backup & hybridization is essential.
- **Cost of Solar & Batteries:** Initial investment is high. Batteries (for night‐time / cloudy days) add cost & maintenance. Import duties/taxes on solar equipment & batteries matter.
- **Cooling, PUE, and Efficiency:** Data centres consume large power for cooling. Solar helps generation, but cooling design must be efficient to avoid overheating and losses. Efficiency metrics like PUE need to be publicly reported and improved.
- **Regulatory Framework & Incentives:** Policies for net metering, subsidies, tax breaks, PPAs need to be strong. Also regulations about data privacy, sovereign cloud infrastructure must be clear.
- **Geographic & Grid Limitations:** Solar output depends on locale; energy transmission and grid stability are sometimes weak. Remote data centres may struggle with connectivity or reliable grid link for backup.

### Who Are the Other Possible Contenders?

Because only a few green data centres are publicly confirmed as of mid-2025, speculatively these might become contenders:

- Large telecom operators / ISPs upgrading data centres might integrate solar / hybrid power.
- IT Parks & Tech Zones, especially those with policy incentives, may build green data centre parks.
- University / research institutes needing GPU/AI infrastructure might build green centres.

### My Take: Where Pakistan Stands & What to Watch

With Data Vault, Pakistan has passed an important milestone: proof that a fully solar-powered AI data centre is not just vision, but reality. This sets a benchmark.

Al Nahal appears promising and may become a major player if executed well.

The government’s push for surplus power allocation and solar boom suggests that green energy infrastructure for data centres is likely to expand rapidly.

Key things to watch: announced capacity (MW), battery storage specs, real uptime (especially at night or during cloudy days), power usage effectiveness (PUE), cost per compute, and how regulation supports or burdens growth.

### Poetic Whisper / Vision for the Future

When data halls hum in Karachi, and solar panels stretch under Sindh skies, each ray of sunshine becomes not just power, but possibility. Green data centres promise a future where technology does not cost the earth, where innovation walks hand in hand with sustainability. If Pakistan holds to this path—investing not just in roof panels, but in efficiency, regulation, education—then the digital revolution here can be clean, inclusive, resilient.
