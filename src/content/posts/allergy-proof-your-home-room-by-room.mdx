Below is a field manual you can carry from threshold to threshold.
Print it, tick each box with a wax pencil, and by the final room you’ll breathe like you just stepped out of a mountain monastery.

### Whole-House Foundations (do these first)

-   **Humidity guard-rail:** 30–50 %. Buy a $15 hygrometer; anything higher is a mold nursery.
-   **Temp sweet-spot:** 68–72 °F (20–22 °C); dust mites throw pool parties above 77 °F.
-   **No-shoes covenant** – leave pollen at the mat, not on the parquet.
-   **HEPA everything** – vacuum, HVAC filter, even the desktop air-purifier beside your bed. Replace filters monthly; mark it on the calendar like a birthday.
-   **Smoke exile** – no cigarettes, no candles scented like “Autumn Cabin.” Combustion is asthma’s exclamation mark.

### 1. Bedroom – The 8-Hour Sanctuary

**Mission:** Make the place where you spend one-third of your life hostile to mites, mold and dander.

| Surface             | Action                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mattress & pillows**  | Slip into zippered dust-mite-proof covers; feel the crinkle of victory.                                                 |
| **Bedding**           | Hot-water baptism every Sunday: 130 °F (54 °C) kills mites in their sleep.                                              |
| **Floors**            | Rip up wall-to-wall carpet if you can; lay hardwood or low-pile rugs you can launder.                                     |
| **Curtains**          | Replace horizontal blinds with washable roller shades; curtains must be cotton you can tug down and fling into the machine. |
| **Clutter**           | Books live on shelves with doors; stuffed toys freeze overnight in a plastic bag (24 h kills mites) once a month.       |
| **Pets**              | Keep them outside the bedroom—yes, even the emotional-support tabby. Bathe weekly; dander down 40%.                       |
| **Air flow**          | Point a HEPA filter’s outflow toward your pillow; white-noise bonus.                                                    |

### 2. Living Room – Where Pollen Comes to Netflix & Chill

| Surface         | Action                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sofas**       | Leather, wood, metal—anything you can wipe, not inhale. If upholstered, vacuum with HEPA weekly; use allergen-blocking throws you can boil-wash. |
| **Plants**      | Spreading aquarium gravel over soil keeps mold spores underground; or gift the fern to a neighbor.                   |
| **Fireplace**   | Wood smoke is particle confetti; switch to sealed gas or just stream a yule-log video.                               |
| **Windows**     | Close during pollen bloom; run A/C on recirculate. Squeegee frames to nix condensation mold.                           |
| **Pet strategy**| Groom outdoors; wash favorite blankets twice a week; store toys in lidded baskets.                                   |

### 3. Kitchen – Grease, Grime & Hidden Mold

| Surface        | Action                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stove**      | Vented exhaust fan that actually exits the building—not the microwave charcoal farce.             |
| **Sink & drip-pan**| Daily wipe; weekly scrub with detergent; mold loves microscopic leftovers.                         |
| **Fridge seals**| Pop them off, swipe with 5% bleach solution monthly; discard science-experiment leftovers.        |
| **Cabinets**   | Store cereal, flour and pet kibble in screw-top glass; deny cockroaches their midnight buffet.     |
| **Trash**      | Lid that clicks shut; empty nightly; rinse bin weekly—cockroaches adore the scent of yesterday’s biryani. |

### 4. Bathroom – The Mold Spa (shut it down)

| Surface         | Action                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shower curtain**| Plastic liner gets a baking-soda bath monthly; squeegee after every use.                  |
| **Grout**         | Weekly mist of 1:10 bleach water; let sit 10 min while you dance to one song, then rinse.   |
| **Ventilation**   | Exhaust fan on during + 30 min after showers; if none, crack window or install a $20 fan on a timer plug. |
| **Humidity**      | Keep door open when idle; small dehumidifier if readings creep > 50 %.                      |

### 5. Basement / Laundry – The Forgotten Kingdom

| Surface         | Action                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dehumidifier**| set to 45 %, drain into sump or empty religiously; label “Holy Grail”. |
| **Washer gasket** | wipe after final load; leave door ajar; mildew stench is a warning, not destiny. |
| **Storage**       | plastic bins with lids; cardboard is a buffet for silverfish and mold. |
| **Pipes**         | inspect for leaks quarterly; one drip = mold starter-kit.             |

### 6. Entire-House Rituals (calendar these)

-   Vacuum twice weekly – slow passes, HEPA on, wear an N-95 if you’re the allergic one.
-   Damp-dust ledges & blinds every Sunday; dry dust just launches allergens into orbit.
-   Change HVAC filter monthly; write the date on the filter frame like a tiny white billboard.
-   Professional carpet clean every 6 months; or Marie-Kondo the rug and embrace bare floors.
-   Seasonal window & door seal check – candle-flame test for drafts; caulk where the flame shivers.

Allergy-proofing is not spring-cleaning—it’s spring defense.

the one who wakes without congestion, who opens windows without fear, who inhales like the world is kind.

May your surfaces be wipeable, your air measurable, and your nights whistle-free.
