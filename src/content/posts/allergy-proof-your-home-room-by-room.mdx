Below is a field manual you can carry from threshold to threshold.
Print it, tick each box with a wax pencil, and by the final room youâ€™ll breathe like you just stepped out of a mountain monastery.

### Whole-House Foundations (do these first)

-   **Humidity guard-rail:** 30â€“50 %. Buy a $15 hygrometer; anything higher is a mold nursery.
-   **Temp sweet-spot:** 68â€“72 Â°F (20â€“22 Â°C); dust mites throw pool parties above 77 Â°F.
-   **No-shoes covenant** â€“ leave pollen at the mat, not on the parquet.
-   **HEPA everything** â€“ vacuum, HVAC filter, even the desktop air-purifier beside your bed. Replace filters monthly; mark it on the calendar like a birthday.
-   **Smoke exile** â€“ no cigarettes, no candles scented like â€œAutumn Cabin.â€ Combustion is asthmaâ€™s exclamation mark.

### 1. Bedroom â€“ The 8-Hour Sanctuary

**Mission:** Make the place where you spend one-third of your life hostile to mites, mold and dander.

| Surface             | Action                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mattress & pillows**  | Slip into zippered dust-mite-proof covers; feel the crinkle of victory.                                                 |
| **Bedding**           | Hot-water baptism every Sunday: 130 Â°F (54 Â°C) kills mites in their sleep.                                              |
| **Floors**            | Rip up wall-to-wall carpet if you can; lay hardwood or low-pile rugs you can launder.                                     |
| **Curtains**          | Replace horizontal blinds with washable roller shades; curtains must be cotton you can tug down and fling into the machine. |
| **Clutter**           | Books live on shelves with doors; stuffed toys freeze overnight in a plastic bag (24 h kills mites) once a month.       |
| **Pets**              | Keep them outside the bedroomâ€”yes, even the emotional-support tabby. Bathe weekly; dander down 40%.                       |
| **Air flow**          | Point a HEPA filterâ€™s outflow toward your pillow; white-noise bonus.                                                    |

### 2. Living Room â€“ Where Pollen Comes to Netflix & Chill

| Surface         | Action                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sofas**       | Leather, wood, metalâ€”anything you can wipe, not inhale. If upholstered, vacuum with HEPA weekly; use allergen-blocking throws you can boil-wash. |
| **Plants**      | Spreading aquarium gravel over soil keeps mold spores underground; or gift the fern to a neighbor.                   |
| **Fireplace**   | Wood smoke is particle confetti; switch to sealed gas or just stream a yule-log video.                               |
| **Windows**     | Close during pollen bloom; run A/C on recirculate. Squeegee frames to nix condensation mold.                           |
| **Pet strategy**| Groom outdoors; wash favorite blankets twice a week; store toys in lidded baskets.                                   |

### 3. Kitchen â€“ Grease, Grime & Hidden Mold

| Surface        | Action                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stove**      | Vented exhaust fan that actually exits the buildingâ€”not the microwave charcoal farce.             |
| **Sink & drip-pan**| Daily wipe; weekly scrub with detergent; mold loves microscopic leftovers.                         |
| **Fridge seals**| Pop them off, swipe with 5% bleach solution monthly; discard science-experiment leftovers.        |
| **Cabinets**   | Store cereal, flour and pet kibble in screw-top glass; deny cockroaches their midnight buffet.     |
| **Trash**      | Lid that clicks shut; empty nightly; rinse bin weeklyâ€”cockroaches adore the scent of yesterdayâ€™s biryani. |

### 4. Bathroom â€“ The Mold Spa (shut it down)

| Surface         | Action                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shower curtain**| Plastic liner gets a baking-soda bath monthly; squeegee after every use.                  |
| **Grout**         | Weekly mist of 1:10 bleach water; let sit 10 min while you dance to one song, then rinse.   |
| **Ventilation**   | Exhaust fan on during + 30 min after showers; if none, crack window or install a $20 fan on a timer plug. |
| **Humidity**      | Keep door open when idle; small dehumidifier if readings creep > 50 %.                      |

### 5. Basement / Laundry â€“ The Forgotten Kingdom

| Surface         | Action                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dehumidifier**| set to 45 %, drain into sump or empty religiously; label â€œHoly Grailâ€. |
| **Washer gasket** | wipe after final load; leave door ajar; mildew stench is a warning, not destiny. |
| **Storage**       | plastic bins with lids; cardboard is a buffet for silverfish and mold. |
| **Pipes**         | inspect for leaks quarterly; one drip = mold starter-kit.             |

### 6. Entire-House Rituals (calendar these)

-   Vacuum twice weekly â€“ slow passes, HEPA on, wear an N-95 if youâ€™re the allergic one.
-   Damp-dust ledges & blinds every Sunday; dry dust just launches allergens into orbit.
-   Change HVAC filter monthly; write the date on the filter frame like a tiny white billboard.
-   Professional carpet clean every 6 months; or Marie-Kondo the rug and embrace bare floors.
-   Seasonal window & door seal check â€“ candle-flame test for drafts; caulk where the flame shivers.

### Shopping List for Instant Wins

âœ“ Zippered allergen-proof mattress & pillow encasements
âœ“ Hygrometer / digital humidity read-out

### Closing Breath

Allergy-proofing is not spring-cleaningâ€”itâ€™s spring defense.
Start with the bedroom (you spend 2,920 hours a year there), then march outward like a benevolent conqueror.
Each closed zipper, each bleach swipe, each humidity percentage point is a love-letter to your future selfâ€”
the one who wakes without congestion, who opens windows without fear, who inhales like the world is kind.

May your surfaces be wipeable, your air measurable, and your nights whistle-free.
