**API** stands for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface.
It is a set of rules that allows two different pieces of software to talk to each other.

## The Restaurant Analogy
Imagine you are a customer at a restaurant.
- **You (The Client)**: You want food (Data).
- **The Kitchen (The Server)**: They have the food and prepare it.
- **But...** You can't just walk into the kitchen and start grabbing ingredients. You need a messenger.
- **The Waiter (The API)**: You give your order to the waiter. The waiter takes it to the kitchen. The kitchen prepares it. The waiter brings the food back to you.

## How Developers Use APIs
You don't need to build a map system from scratch. You just use Google Maps API.
Here is how simple it is to "order" data using JavaScript:

```javascript
// The Order (Request)
fetch('https://api.weather.com/london')
  .then(response => response.json()) // The Waiter brings the food
  .then(data => {
    // Eating the food
    console.log(`It is currently ${data.temp} degrees in London.`);
  });
```

## Types of Web APIs
1.  **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: The standard architecture. Uses HTTP methods like `GET` (read), `POST` (create), `DELETE` (remove).
2.  **GraphQL**: A modern alternative that asks for specific data fields to avoid over-fetching.

## Conclusion
APIs are the building blocks of modern software. They allow developers to stand on the shoulders of giants—integrating Maps, Payments (Stripe), or AI (OpenAI) into their apps with just a few lines of code.
