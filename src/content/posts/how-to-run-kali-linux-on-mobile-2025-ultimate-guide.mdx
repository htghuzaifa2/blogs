Imagine walking into a coffee shop and auditing the security of the WiFi network using nothing but your phone. This isn't a scene from *Mr. Robot*; it's reality with **Kali Linux on Android**.

Whether you have a rooted device or a standard phone, you can turn your pocket computer into a powerful hacking station.

## Method 1: No Root Required (Termux + NetHunter Rootless)
This is safer and works on almost any modern Android phone. You won't get hardware access (like WiFi injection), but you get the full software toolkit.

**Steps:**
1.  **Install Termux** from F-Droid (do not use the Play Store version, it's outdated).
2.  **Update packages**: `pkg update && pkg upgrade`.
3.  **Install NetHunter**:
    ```bash
    termux-setup-storage
    pkg install wget
    wget -O install-nethunter-termux https://offs.ec/2MceZWr
    chmod +x install-nethunter-termux
    ./install-nethunter-termux
    ```
4.  **Run**: Type `nethunter` to enter the Kali shell.
5.  **GUI**: Type `kex` to start a VNC server and view the desktop using the "NetHunter Kex" app.

## Method 2: Rooted Device (Full NetHunter)
If you have a supported device (like a OnePlus, Nexus, or Sony Xperia) and are willing to root it, this is the "god mode."
- **Custom Kernel**: Allows for WiFi injection and HID attacks.
- **BadUSB**: Your phone can act as a malicious keyboard when plugged into a PC.
- **SDR**: Software Defined Radio support.

## What Can You Do?
- **Nmap**: Scan networks for open ports.
- **Metasploit**: Test vulnerabilities in systems.
- **Wireshark**: Analyze network traffic (requires root/pcap).
- **Social Engineering**: Run phishing tests (for educational purposes only!).

## Disclaimer
**Ethical Hacking Only**. Accessing networks or systems without permission is illegal. Use these tools only on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.
