Next.js is a powerful React framework for building fast, modern, and scalable web applications. With the release of version 14, it introduced several groundbreaking features that have changed the way developers build React apps. This guide will walk you through the key features and how to use them effectively.

## The App Router
The most significant change in Next.js 14 is the introduction of the **App Router**, which replaces the traditional `pages` directory. It offers a more flexible and powerful way to handle routing, layouts, and server-side rendering.

- **Layouts:** Easily create shared UI that persists across multiple routes.
- **Server Components:** Render components on the server by default, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving load times.
- **Client Components:** Opt-in to client-side interactivity with the `'use client'` directive.

## Server Actions
Server Actions simplify data mutations by allowing you to run server-side code directly from your components, without needing to manually create API endpoints. This is a game-changer for handling form submissions and other user interactions.

```javascript
// app/page.tsx
export default function MyPage() {
  async function create(formData: FormData) {
    'use server';
    // ... logic to save to database
  }

  return (
    <form action={create}>
      <input type="text" name="name" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Other Key Features
- **Improved Performance:** Next.js 14 is faster than ever, with optimizations in both the build process and runtime performance.
- **Enhanced Data Fetching:** The extended `fetch` API provides more control over caching and revalidation.
- **Turbopack:** An incremental bundler written in Rust that offers significantly faster build times for local development.

Next.js 14 empowers developers to build highly performant and interactive applications with a more intuitive and powerful toolset.
