Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of React. It provides a structure for your application and enables functionalities like server-side rendering (SSR) and generating static websites, which are not available out-of-the-box with React.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Renders React components on the server, which can improve performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pre-renders pages at build time, leading to blazing-fast load times.
- **File-based Routing:** Pages are automatically created based on the file structure in the `pages` or `app` directory.
- **API Routes:** Easily create API endpoints as part of your Next.js application.
- **Image Optimization:** Built-in component for optimizing images for better performance.

Next.js simplifies the process of building production-ready React applications, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than configuring tools.
