### What is a REST API?

A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocolâ€”almost always HTTP. REST APIs are the backbone of modern web services, allowing different applications to communicate with each other over the internet.

### Why Node.js and Express?

- **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server, making it perfect for building fast and scalable network applications.
- **Express** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building APIs by providing tools for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses.

### Setting Up Your Project

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

1.  **Initialize your project:**
    ```bash
    mkdir my-api
    cd my-api
    npm init -y
    ```

2.  **Install Express:**
    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```

### Creating Your First Server

Create a file named `index.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
Run your server with `node index.js`. You can now visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and see "Hello, World!".

### Building API Endpoints (Routing)

A REST API is defined by its endpoints. Let's create a simple in-memory "database" and build CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for a collection of users.

```javascript
// ... (keep the initial setup code)

let users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob' }
];

// GET all users
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json(users);
});

// GET a single user by ID
app.get('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!user) return res.status(404).send('User not found.');
  res.json(user);
});

// POST a new user
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  if (!req.body.name || req.body.name.length < 3) {
    return res.status(400).send('Name is required and should be minimum 3 characters.');
  }
  const newUser = {
    id: users.length + 1,
    name: req.body.name
  };
  users.push(newUser);
  res.status(201).json(newUser);
});

// PUT (update) a user
app.put('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!user) return res.status(404).send('User not found.');

  user.name = req.body.name;
  res.json(user);
});

// DELETE a user
app.delete('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userIndex = users.findIndex(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (userIndex === -1) return res.status(404).send('User not found.');

  const deletedUser = users.splice(userIndex, 1);
  res.json(deletedUser);
});


// ... (keep the app.listen code)
```

### Next Steps: Connecting to a Database

While an in-memory array is great for learning, a real-world application needs a persistent database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL. You would use a library like `Mongoose` (for MongoDB) or `Sequelize` (for SQL databases) to connect your Express app to the database and replace the `users` array with database queries.

### Conclusion

You've successfully built a basic REST API with Node.js and Express! You've learned how to set up a server, create routes for different HTTP methods, and perform CRUD operations. This is a fundamental skill for any back-end or full-stack developer. From here, you can explore middleware for authentication, error handling, and connecting to a real database.
