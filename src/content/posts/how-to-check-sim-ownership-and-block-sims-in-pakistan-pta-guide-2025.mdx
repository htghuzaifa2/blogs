### Part 1: Check SIMs Registered Under Your CNIC

3.  **Receive Details**: Reply lists all active SIMs, operators, and registration dates.

#### Method 2: PTA Website (Detailed Report)
1.  Visit **cnic.sims.pk**.
2.  Enter CNIC + solve CAPTCHA.
3.  View table showing:
    *   Mobile numbers linked to your CNIC
    *   Network operators (Jazz/Zong/Ufone/Telenor)
    *   Biometric verification status
    *   Registration status (active/inactive).

#### Method 3: MyPTA App
1.  Download MyPTA (Google Play/App Store).
2.  Register with CNIC + mobile number.
3.  Access real-time SIM details.

### Part 2: Block Unauthorized or Lost SIMs

#### Step 1: Block via Mobile Operator
1.  **Visit Franchise**: Carry original CNIC + copies to operator’s outlet (Jazz/Telenor/Zong/Ufone).
2.  **Submit Form**: Request immediate blocking of unauthorized SIMs.
3.  **Helpline Support**:

#### Step 2: Report to PTA (If Operator Fails)

-   **Email**: Send evidence to help@pta.gov.pk.

#### Critical 2025 Deadlines
-   **Deceased Users**: SIMs under expired CNICs blocked after 15 Sept 2025 (submit death certificate to transfer ownership).
-   **Expired CNICs**: Renew by 2 Sept 2025 to avoid blocking.

### Part 3: Block Stolen/Lost Phones via DIRBS

#### Method 1: PTA DIRBS Portal
1.  Visit **dirbs.pta.gov.pk** → "Block Lost/Stolen Device".
2.  Enter device IMEI (dial `*#06#` to find IMEI).

#### Method 2: PTA CMS App
1.  Install PTA CMS (Device Blocking App).
2.  Log in → Enter IMEI + police report copy.
3.  Track blocking status via SMS alerts.

**Note**: Blocked phones cannot be used on any Pakistani network.

-   **Deceased User Cleanup**: 163,200+ illegal SIMs blocked since June 2025.
