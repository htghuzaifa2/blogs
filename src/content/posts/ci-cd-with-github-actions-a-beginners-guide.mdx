## Introduction: Why Automate?
<p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is the practice of automating your software development lifecycle. GitHub Actions is a powerful and flexible CI/CD platform built directly into GitHub.</p>
      
### Building Your First CI Pipeline
<p>A GitHub Actions workflow is defined in a YAML file in the `.github/workflows/` directory. Here's a simple example for a Node.js application that runs tests on every push.</p>
      
### Continuous Deployment
<p>You can add a second job to deploy your application if the tests pass. This job would use a conditional to run only on pushes to the main branch and would use secrets to store your deployment credentials securely.</p>
