*â€œThe algorithm is no longer the editor-in-chiefâ€”itâ€™s the entire newsroom. Learn to collaborate, or be edited out.â€*

### 1. 2025 in Numbers: AI Has Moved Into the Driverâ€™s Seat
- **4.8 billion** pieces of content are auto-generated daily across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn.
- **87%** of users discover new creators via AI-curated feeds rather than search bars.
- **$19.8 billion** was spent on AI-driven social media ads last yearâ€”up 312% versus 2023.

| Stage         | Traditional Way        | AI-Powered Way (2025)                                                  |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ideation**  | Brainstorm in Notion   | Sprinklr AI suggests trending hooks based on 60s of global data        |

| **Visuals**   | Shoot, edit, export    | Runway Gen-3 turns a 30-word prompt into a 9:16 reel in 45 seconds    |

- **Dynamic captions:** Same video, 12 language variants auto-rendered with region-specific slang.
- **Real-time offers:** If a user pauses on your reel, AI sends them a 10% discount link before they scroll away.
