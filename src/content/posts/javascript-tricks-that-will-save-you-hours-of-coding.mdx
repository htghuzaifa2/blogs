JavaScript has evolved rapidly. If you are still writing code like it's 2015, you are missing out on syntax that makes your code cleaner, shorter, and safer. Here are 5 modern tricks to level up your JS.

## 1. Optional Chaining (`?.`)
Stop checking if properties exist before accessing them.
**Old Way:**
```javascript
if (user && user.address && user.address.street) {
  console.log(user.address.street);
}
```
**New Way:**
```javascript
console.log(user?.address?.street);
```
If any part of the chain is `null` or `undefined`, it simply returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

## 2. Nullish Coalescing (`??`)
Use this instead of `||` when you want to provide a default value.
**The Problem with `||`**: It treats `0` and `""` (empty string) as falsey.
```javascript
let count = 0;
let amount = count || 10; // amount is 10! (Wrong, if 0 was a valid count)
```
**The Solution**:
```javascript
let amount = count ?? 10; // amount is 0
```
`??` only falls back if the value is strictly `null` or `undefined`.

## 3. Object Destructuring with Aliases
You can rename variables while destructuring.
```javascript
const user = { name: "Huzi", age: 25 };
const { name: userName } = user;

console.log(userName); // "Huzi"
```

## 4. Remove Duplicates from an Array
The fastest way to dedupe an array is using a `Set`.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4];
const unique = [...new Set(numbers)]; 
// [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## 5. Short-Circuit Evaluation
Use `&&` to run code only if a condition is true.
```javascript
isLoggedIn && showDashboard();
```
This is cleaner than writing an `if` statement for simple conditional execution.

## Conclusion
Writing less code means fewer bugs to maintain. Incorporate these syntactic sugars into your daily workflow, and your codebase will thank you.
