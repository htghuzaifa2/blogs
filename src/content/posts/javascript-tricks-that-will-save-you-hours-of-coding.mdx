<p>JavaScript is full of hidden gems that can transform verbose code into elegant solutions. Master these battle-tested tricks to write cleaner, more efficient code immediately.</p>
      
### 1. Destructuring with Aliases & Default Values
<p>Safely access nested properties and avoid naming conflicts.</p>
```javascript
const { address: { street: userStreet = 'Unknown' } = {} } = user;
```

### 2. Optional Chaining + Nullish Coalescing
<p>The ultimate combo for safe property access without long `&&` chains.</p>
```javascript
const price = order?.items?.[0]?.price ?? 0;
```
      
### 3. Array Deduplication with Set
<p>The cleanest way to get unique values from an array.</p>
```javascript
const unique = [...new Set(myArray)];
```
