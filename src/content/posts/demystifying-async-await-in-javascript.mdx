## Introduction: The Problem of Asynchronous Code
<p>JavaScript is single-threaded, but it needs to handle long-running tasks like API calls without freezing. This guide explains how it accomplishes this, moving from "Callback Hell" to the clean syntax of Promises and modern <strong>async/await</strong>.</p>
      
### The Promise: A Better Way
<p>A `Promise` is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. We handle these states with `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for failure.</p>

### The Modern Way: Async/Await
<p>`async/await` is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.</p>
