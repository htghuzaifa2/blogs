â€œa home is just a story in brickâ€”
add your own punctuation with peel-&-stick commas and neon exclamation marks.â€
â€”Huzi

Below: rupee-friendly makeovers, rental-safe hacks, and laugh-sized tutorials tested in hostel rooms, bachelor pads, and mummy-monitored lounges.
Roll up your shalwar, grab a cup of chai-glue, and letâ€™s build beauty without breaking the bankâ€”or the wall.

## VII. Final Nail

DIY isnâ€™t about perfectionâ€”**itâ€™s about â€œI made thisâ€ vs â€œI bought thisâ€.**
Every peel, every drill, every wobbly shelf is a verse in your homeâ€™s autobiography.
So measure once, brag forever, and remember:
if the nail bends, call it abstract art.

See you on the ladder-side,
