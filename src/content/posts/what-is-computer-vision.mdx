Human vision is incredibly complex. In a fraction of a second, your eyes capture light, your brain processes it, and you instantly recognize "That is a cat jumping on a table."

**Computer Vision (CV)** is the field of AI focused on giving computers this same capability.

## How Does a Computer "See"?
To a computer, an image is just a massive grid of numbers (pixels).
- A black-and-white image is a 2D grid where each number represents brightness (0 = black, 255 = white).
- A color image is a 3D grid (Red, Green, Blue channels).

The challenge of CV is teaching a computer that a specific pattern of numbers represents a "face" or a "stop sign," regardless of lighting, angle, or occlusion.

## The Technology: CNNs
The breakthrough in CV came with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
- Imagine looking at an image through a small sliding window.
- The first layer of the network detects simple edges (lines, curves).
- The next layer combines those edges to find shapes (circles, squares).
- The deeper layers combine shapes to find features (eyes, wheels).
- The final layer identifies the object (Dog, Car).

## Applications
1.  **Self-Driving Cars**: Tesla and Waymo use CV to detect lanes, pedestrians, and traffic lights in real-time.
2.  **Healthcare**: Detecting tumors in X-rays with higher accuracy than human radiologists.
3.  **FaceID**: Unlocking your iPhone by creating a 3D map of your face.
4.  **Agriculture**: Drones flying over fields to identify weeds and spray them precisely, reducing chemical usage.

## Conclusion
Computer Vision is bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds. As it advances, machines will not just be able to think (AI) but to perceive and interact with the world around them safely and intelligently.
