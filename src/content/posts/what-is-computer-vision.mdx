Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe, and understand.

## How does it work?

Computer vision works by applying machine learning models to analyze visual data. These models are trained on vast amounts of labeled data to recognize patterns, objects, and features. For example, a model might be trained on millions of images of cats to learn how to identify a cat in a new, unseen image.

## Applications

- **Self-driving cars:** To see and understand the road, obstacles, and traffic signs.
- **Facial recognition:** For security, and unlocking your phone.
- **Medical imaging analysis:** To help doctors diagnose diseases from X-rays and MRIs.
- **Retail:** For inventory management and analyzing customer behavior.
