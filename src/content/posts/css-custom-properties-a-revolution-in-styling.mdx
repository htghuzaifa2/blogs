## Introduction: The New Way of Styling
<p>CSS Custom Properties (or variables) allow you to store values for reuse throughout your stylesheet. Unlike variables in preprocessors like SASS, they are dynamic and can be manipulated with JavaScript, revolutionizing theming and component-based styling.</p>

### The Basics: Declaration and Usage
<p>Declare a custom property on the `:root` selector for global scope, and use it with the `var()` function.</p>
      
### The JavaScript Connection: Dynamic Theming
<p>The ability to change custom properties with JavaScript makes creating features like a dark/light mode toggle incredibly simple. By changing a single attribute on the `<html>` tag, the entire UI can react without needing to add/remove classes on multiple elements.</p>
      
<div className="italic text-center text-muted-foreground pt-4 border-t mt-8">
  In root they're born, through styles they flow,<br/>
  With var(), a theme begins to grow.
</div>
