<p>Python is one of the most popular and influential programming languages in the world. Known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, Python has become the go-to language for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more.</p>
<p>Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python‚Äôs philosophy emphasizes code readability and developer productivity. Today, it powers everything from Instagram‚Äôs backend to NASA projects and AI systems like ChatGPT.</p>
### Overview of Python
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed language. Unlike compiled languages like C++ or Java, Python code runs line by line, making it easier to test and debug.</p>
#### Why Learn Python?
<ul>
  <li>‚úÖ Beginner-friendly ‚Äì Clean, readable syntax.</li>
  <li>‚úÖ Multi-purpose ‚Äì Used in web apps, automation, data science, AI, scripting.</li>
  <li>‚úÖ Massive Community ‚Äì Huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.</li>
  <li>‚úÖ In-demand Skill ‚Äì Python is one of the most sought-after programming skills.</li>
  <li>‚úÖ Cross-platform ‚Äì Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi, etc.</li>
</ul>
### Data Structures in Python
<p>Python has powerful built-in data structures:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>List:</strong> Ordered and mutable. `fruits = ["apple", "banana"]`</li>
  <li><strong>Tuple:</strong> Ordered and immutable. `coordinates = (10, 20)`</li>
  <li><strong>Set:</strong> Unordered with unique items. `unique_nums = {1, 2, 3}`</li>
  <li><strong>Dictionary:</strong> Key-value pairs. `person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`</li>
</ul>
