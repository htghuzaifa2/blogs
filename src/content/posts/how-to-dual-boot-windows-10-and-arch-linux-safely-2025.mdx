# How to Dual Boot Windows 10 and Arch Linux Safely (2025 Updated Guide)

If you love Windows 10 but also want the power and flexibility of Arch Linux, dual-booting is the best of both worlds. You can switch between Windows for work or gaming and Arch Linux for coding, customization, and learning Linux deeply.

In this blog, I"™ll walk you through "” step-by-step "” how to safely install Arch Linux alongside Windows 10, covering BIOS/UEFI setup, partitioning, GRUB bootloader installation, and recovery tips. Let"™s make sure you don"™t lose your data in the process!

## What You"™ll Need

Before we start, here"™s what you"™ll need ready:

-   ðŸ’½ A USB drive (at least 4GB)
-   ðŸªŸ Windows 10 already installed
-   ðŸŒ Internet connection
-   ðŸ§  Basic command-line knowledge
-   ðŸ“€ Arch Linux ISO "” Download from [official site](https://archlinux.org/download/)
-   ðŸ§° A tool like Rufus or Balena Etcher (to make a bootable USB)

## Step 1: Prepare Windows for Dual Boot

### Backup your data "” Always first.

### Disable Fast Startup & Hibernation:

```bash
powercfg /h off
```

Go to: `Control Panel` â†’ `Power Options` â†’ `Choose what power buttons do` â†’ Uncheck "Turn on fast startup"

### Shrink Windows Partition to make space for Arch:

1.  Press `Win + X` â†’ `Disk Management`
2.  Right-click your main drive (C:)
3.  Select `Shrink Volume`
4.  Leave at least 40GB free for Arch Linux

You"™ll now have **unallocated space** "” don"™t format it! Arch installer will handle it.

## Step 2: Create a Bootable Arch Linux USB

Use Rufus (on Windows):

-   Select your USB drive
-   Choose the Arch ISO file
-   Set:
    -   **Partition scheme** â†’ `GPT` (for UEFI) or `MBR` (for BIOS)
    -   **File System** â†’ `FAT32`
-   Click `Start`

## Step 3: Boot Into Arch Linux Installer

1.  Restart your PC
2.  Enter BIOS/UEFI (press F2, Del, or Esc depending on your system)
3.  Disable `Secure Boot`
4.  Set your USB as the first boot device
5.  Boot "” you"™ll see the Arch Linux live menu. Choose: `Boot Arch Linux (x86_64)`

## Step 4: Check Internet Connection

### For Ethernet (wired):

```bash
ping archlinux.org
```

If you see replies, you"™re good.

### For Wi-Fi:

```bash
iwctl
device list
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect YourWiFiName
exit
ping archlinux.org
```

## Step 5: Partition the Disk

Run:

```bash
lsblk
```

Find your drive (e.g., `/dev/sda` or `/dev/nvme0n1`).

We"™ll use `cfdisk` "” it"™s easy and safe.

```bash
cfdisk /dev/sda
```

Choose: `GPT` (if UEFI) or `DOS/MBR` (if BIOS)

Now create:

1.  **EFI partition** (if UEFI):
    -   Size: `512MB`
    -   Type: `EFI System`
2.  **Root partition** (Linux):
    -   Use the unallocated space you created earlier
    -   Type: `Linux filesystem`
3.  **(Optional) Swap:**
    -   Size: `2"“4GB`
    -   Type: `Linux swap`

`Write` changes â†’ confirm â†’ `quit`.

## Step 6: Format Partitions

### For UEFI systems:

```bash
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1
```

### For the root partition:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
```

### If you made a swap partition:

```bash
mkswap /dev/sda3
swapon /dev/sda3
```

## Step 7: Mount the Partitions

```bash
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```

## Step 8: Install Base System

```bash
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware vim networkmanager
```

Then generate `fstab`:

```bash
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

## Step 9: Chroot Into the System

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

### Set timezone:

```bash
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Karachi /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
```

### Set locale:

```bash
echo "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
```

### Set hostname:

```bash
echo "archpc" > /etc/hostname
```

### Set root password:

```bash
passwd
```

## Step 10: Install GRUB Bootloader

### For UEFI systems:

```bash
pacman -S grub efibootmgr os-prober
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=Arch
os-prober
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### For Legacy BIOS systems:

```bash
pacman -S grub os-prober
grub-install /dev/sda
os-prober
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

âœ… You"™ll see that GRUB detects your Windows Boot Manager automatically!

## Step 11: Enable Network and Exit

```bash
systemctl enable NetworkManager
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

Remove the USB when prompted.

## Step 12: Boot Menu (Choose OS)

On reboot, you"™ll see the GRUB menu:

-   `Arch Linux`
-   `Windows Boot Manager`

You can switch easily between both OSes whenever you boot.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### If GRUB doesn"™t show Windows:

```bash
sudo os-prober
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### If booting directly into Windows:

Go into BIOS and ensure Arch/GRUB is first in the boot order.

### If Arch doesn"™t boot:

1.  Boot into live USB again
2.  Mount root partition:
    ```bash
    mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
    arch-chroot /mnt
    grub-install /dev/sda
    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    reboot
    ```

## Bonus Tip: Keep Both OSes Clean

-   Don"™t touch Windows partitions from Linux unless you know what you"™re doing.
-   Keep Windows updates enabled.
-   Use `Timeshift` in Linux for snapshots "” it can save you during a failed update.

## Final Thoughts

Dual-booting Windows 10 and Arch Linux gives you the power to enjoy both ecosystems "” productivity in Windows, and full control in Linux. If you follow this guide carefully, you"™ll have a smooth dual-boot setup with zero data loss.
