### After-word

Copy the quote that stabbed you deepest.

Paste it on your mirror, your Twitter bio, your classroom door.

Let it follow you like a shadow until you answer with actionâ€”
a tree, a vote, a strike, a refusal to fly, a refusal to stay silent.

The atmosphere is a cathedral; every syllable we utter either sings or scars.

Choose the hymn.
Choose the hammer.

But chooseâ€”
before the sky chooses for us.
